  //Story of Eastern Wonderland
  "The title theme. It's a pretty long song for a title screen, so the demo will start if you try to listen to the whole thing. \n So, what part of this is Eastern?", "The first stage theme. It (the atmosphere) sounds heavy. A lot of shmups have really upbeat first stage themes, and this song is, too, but it's so dark. Even though the story for this game is a joke, the music is so serious, and the enemies are so hard. \n I like that kind of mismatch.", "The stage 1 boss theme. I tried to make it feel as weak as possible. I think this song sounds a little oriental.", "The second stage theme, I actually wrote this quite some time ago, so I think it feels different than the other songs. Actually, I wrote this song envisioning the dawn, but there weren't any scenes like that in the game, so I'm using it for a night scene. I wanted it to contrast the first stage theme - day and night, light and darkness - but the first stage theme was too heavy. Mmmm~", "The stage 2 boss theme. I tried making something cool, but it's really short, isn't it?", "I wonder just where the World of Fantasies is? I don't think it's anywhere in outer space, but...", "The third stage boss theme. The boss suddenly gets strong in this stage. However, the song has a long loop, so about the time the main melody ends; the boss should be dead.", "The '~ni moe' in the title means burning, I think it's definitely different from moe~ The rhythm is unusual. In a word, strange. Ah, what's Oriental about this song, anyway~", "Marisa's theme. She's the strongest magical girl. I tried to make the song feel like something from an anime, but try as I might, I just couldn't make something that had that heroine feel to it (I'm still practicing), so I tried to make something strong and witchy. I think it feels a little oriental.", "This was going to be the title song. Now it's an uninteresting stage 5 theme. To tell you the truth, this is the first song I made in PMD, so it didn't go that well, but it's the only song that changes rhythm. (The only one?) Still, it's the song I'm most familiar with.", "Mima's theme. There are a few points that I think are promised to last boss themes. Needless to say, it can't be too light, it can't be too simple, and it has to be mysterious, among other things. Of course, that's my opinion, so others may not agree.", "This is the Extra Stage song. This song and the next are all, are you sure you want to keep going? Let's do our best to beat the next person with a no continue clear. (Easy is fine, too.) So, that's what the song is like. Yep. Uja uja...", "The theme for a certain girl genius. At the early par, it's deliberately meant to feel particularly cute. In later part, I intended to finish the song in a cool style. The song uses the same progression as Extra Love. Still, conversely, this song is... too strong (^^;", "The ending song. It's a little dark, but the ending isn't really dark at all.", "The staff roll song. I thought the staff roll song should be an upbeat song with strong rhythm, but... It's energetic, but isn't it a little too dark?", "I made this, intending for it to be the first stage theme, but... Since the early songs in Highly Responsive to Prayers were so dark, so I thought I'd make this one brighter, and it ended up like this. But, I threw it out (^^;;;;", "I was going to use this for stage 2. It's not bad, but... It felt half-hearted, so I threw it out.", "I had planned on using this for the staff roll , but... The rhythm is so light it's almost unthinkable now (^^;;; It has a rather fine pedigree, but it didn't balance well with the other songs in the game, so I threw it out.",
  //Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream
  "This is the title music. Suddenly it doesn't seem too Touhou-like, right? \n Even if I do say so myself, for someone who's made music with such an unsuitable atmosphere I don't look too worried, I've been thinking lately. \n But lately, maybe it's because I've become accustomed to such an atmosphere, or maybe I actually am in this kind of atmosphere. I feel my game has to be like this or it's no good. \n In any case, right from the beginning I'm already talking about music like this. Oh no!", "What should I talk about for this song? (lol) \n It's a pretty heavy song, isn't it? \n Why is the character select song for a game with such a silly story like this? \n Oh well, it's pretty short... (The song, the development time, and the comments.)", "The game's main character also happens to be a shrine maiden, but... \n Is this really a shrine maiden's song? Well, uh. That's. You see. \n But, I do like it. And it does have a rather oriental feel to it, and the melody is pretty nice. Right? (Begging)", "For those who don't know Mima, she was the last boss from the last game, Story of Eastern Wonderland. \n This time, she's not a boss or anything, just a normal character, so I tried not to make her theme song too badass... \n You know, I just don't get her personality at all. \n (Even though she's my own character *sweatdrop*) \n Well, what about the song. The melody for the main chorus part is very simple, but feels really nice... Doesn't it? (Maybe because it's simple?)", "For those who don't know Mima, she was the last boss from the last game, Story of Eastern Wonderland. \n This time, she's not a boss or anything, just a normal character, so I tried not to make her theme song too badass... \n You know, I just don't get her personality at all. \n (Even though she's my own character *sweatdrop*) \n Well, what about the song. The melody for the main chorus part is very simple, but feels really nice... Doesn't it? (Maybe because it's simple?)", "Yeees. The composer is not too good at cute songs. This song doesn't seem very cute, does it? \n (If anyone knows the comic Ellen came from... sorry, it doesn't match her very well, does it?) \n Well, anyway, this song is actually a song I wrote a loooooong time ago to practice MIDI; I rewrote it all in FM. \n It was one of my favorite original songs, but it was completely Oriental-style, and... (I think this song is, too ...) I don't know how it ended up being a foreign girl's theme.", "She's a strange character. It's a strange song. Yes. \n What to say, what to say .... yeah. \n Well, I guess the high-speed xylophone-like sound is the main attraction for this song. \n Anyway, the melody's pretty weird. Do you all think so too? I knew it.", "She isn't human, either... \n When I'm making up characters, I'll write down a bunch on paper, and just choose some.

Its unusual beat toys with your sense of speed, sometimes seeming to go faster. \n I was trying for a rock piece, but as I don't listen to rock much, it's quite possible that I have no idea what I'm doing (^^;", "Izayoi Sakuya's theme. \n You can't have a maid without hard rock (jk) \n It's quite driving, fitting for the second-to-last stage. \n ...Guess I still don't know much about rick (^^; \n Let's just call it 'private, poetical rock'.", "Final stage theme. \n The final stage themes have always been loaded, so I made it upbeat this time. As the final stage itself is quite short, I made this piece not as assertive.", "Remilia Scarlet's theme. \n With this, I tried for a \"This is the end!\" feeling. \n I didn't want it to be regal or ominous, which is normal for a final stage, so I made it Jazz-Fusion based with a hint of loli... wait, that's not any different than normal. \n Its melody is easy for even me to get, so I like this song.", "Extra stage theme. \n Sometimes it's Chinese, sometimes it's New Age. Why? \n This is what happens after messing with my keyboard. \n It's like an accumulation of my laziness. If you listen closely, there are many strange rhythms in this song. In other words, my toy-box.", "Flandre Scarlet's theme. \n I liked this one the best out of the whole game. It depicts a devilish girl in am Oriental and mysterious way. \n Loli-tastic melodies like this are what I'm best at, so I had a lot of fun composing this.", "Ending theme. \n As you can guess from its name, this is an arranged version of the title theme. So it's also in a Japanese style. \n Well, not that there's anything wrong with that.", "Staff Roll theme. \n The staff roll has always been dark and desperate, so I made it a bit more happy and hopeful this time. I think. \n As the staff list is always short, I couldn't write a long piece. I could have made it more magnificent, but it ended up a little dry. That was not my intention (Laughs)",

  //Perfect Cherry Blossom
  "The title theme, strongly influenced from the previous one, all in a Japanese style. This song completely removes any hint of the upcoming storm of danmaku. Frankly, I think this song isn't necessary, but it's also meant to restrain the player's excitement for danmaku. (lol)", "As the title implies (for nothing at all to be there), this theme was composed with an image of nature that has yet to be discovered by humans. However, I personally didn't want it to be healing music, oddly enough, so I made it somewhat rhythmical. But it doesn't feel invigorating at all. (^^;", "A goal of my music is to subtly blend Japanese and Western elements together (applies to the other songs too). This one is short because it's the theme for the stage 1 boss, but I managed to express my image of the realm in this theme. While the song is direct, it's a strange one that doesn't fit into any music genre.", "This song is a weird one. Yeah. My original intent with this was to make it highly folkish, but since it's too calm, it ended up half-folkish. I composed this with the image of Tono village in mind. The melody is a bit nostalgic and makes you imagine that there used to be old villages like this in Japan, too.", "I composed this title with the image of an energetic youkai girl in mind. This song is based purely on improvisation, because I found that if I think too much while composing the music tends to end up strange. Well, with the help of more than a little booze... All in all, this is an honest song (^^;", "This makes you wonder if you're near the end of the game. This is because the demo was released very early and I had to finished it so it would be ready in time. Due to that, I put the first pivotal moment in stage 3. The mood is more serious than usual, too. However, that means it's similar to my older tunes. It might be just me, but this song gives a nostalgic feeling.", "Alice is kind of a special character in this series, so I composed the theme with renewed vigor (not that I was lazy with the other songs). This theme's goal is to show that the characters' peace of mind despite the intensity of the fight. This peace of mind shows their virtue in my opinion... (the virtue is) not the gothic-lolita costumes, I swear (haha).", "The style is more Chinese than Japanese. A wonderful place above the clouds. As the true beginning of this game, stage 4 is far longer than the others. There's never been such a stratospheric (it's not that high) intrusion with violent yet sorrowful music, has there? While I composed it with \"Journey to the West\" in mind, it doesn't resemble that.", "I tried to make this theme sound like it was being performed brightly and joyfully. A performance by happy-go-lucky sisters who love festivals and anything noisy. At the climax, each of them play their violin, trumpet and keyboard as they please. A veritable hodgepodge.", "This theme expresses the nostalgia that is deep within every Japanese and the frantic feeling that arises when someone is approaching. The sounds of far-off Shinto flutes and bells conjure up images of the netherworld. Or maybe it's just me?", "I tried to give the impression of both \"A Tough Opponent\" and \"Childishness\" with this theme. Perhaps this is the most boss-like theme in this game. While it uses guitar, I gave up trying to make it sound like rock music almost immediately. The hook's melody resembles the youkai.", "The final stage is all about the final boss, so the mid-stage is only a token effort. Because of that, this song is rather short, but it's also refreshing and pleasant (in my opinion). The stage has visual imagery of flying over a sea of cherry blossoms; I hope this song will give you the same impression.", "I gave this theme an oriental and melodious feeling while making it the \"final\" song. Having said that, the style of music is my usual fare. (lol) Vehement yet elegant, powerful but ephemeral; I thought I'd make this theme quite emotional.", "An arranged version of Yuyuko's theme. I put more emphasis on the mysterious atmosphere in this one. However, the melody itself is so harsh that it's almost tiresome. (lol)", "A high-paced theme (?) which is unusual in the Touhou series. It's obvious from the stage that the tempo and feel are the keys to this song. The tone turns around about 112 degrees in the middle of the song which is where Extra really starts (heh)", "I composed it to be more dazzling than fantastic. Hopefully you'll get the sense of the energetic youkai from the song. In my opinion, when there's a long fight in a shooting game, the music should repeat and sustain its tempo. That is, it should be like this theme.", "Another version of Spiritual Domination. It's not that different from the original though...", "Meant to be an arranged version of Ran's theme, it ended up quite different. this one has an ominous feeling. Or rather, she's the very embodiment of ominous. Even compared with the past characters, she has a devious appearance, a dubious character and thoughtless danmaku. The theme's just like her: devious (lol).", "The ending theme. ...It's just, it feels kind of dark. \n It's supposed to represent a peacful, everyday life, I swear.", "The imagery is based on the familiar song \"Sakura, Sakura\". I think this song is kind of refreshing.",

  //Imperishable Night
  "This is the title screen theme. \n I envisioned this song with the same atmosphere as the previous games. \n I feel it's more \"genso-like\", but it's very Gensokyo. \n Can we really say \"genso-like\" really an abbreviation for \"Gensokyo-like\"? \n Well, as for as title themes go, this is one of my favourites.", "This is the Stage 1 theme. \n I think it's a good idea to give the first stage a catchy little number, but while it's pretty upbeat, it is rather dark. \n But Imperishable Night is about night and youkai, so its darkness fits. \n This song is part of \"Ghostly Field Club\", so many of you might know it. \n The darkness in Stage 1 doesn't bode very well.", "This is Wriggle Nightbug's theme. \n It feels so explosively Eastern as always. \n I created it with the innocence of an energetic child mixed with the images of night and insects. 40 small, wriggling insects. \n All the MIDI versions are extras, not just this song. Please listen to the WAV if possible. There's an element of fantasy that just isn't in the MIDI.", "This is the stage 2 theme. \n You're in a hurry, but there's no pressure; rather, it feels like there's still plenty of time left. That's the kind of atmosphere I tried to create with this song. \n It was meant to be my take on the ultimate blend of the Japanese and Western styles. \n On an unrelated note, the girls in Gensokyo have no sense of danger. They're just enjoying their lives to the fullest...", "This is Mystia Lorelei's theme. \n She's just a Stage 2 boss, but this song makes her sound like a powerful foe. \n The theme has nothing to do with mystery of birds or night or anything weird like that. I just made this song to be cute and awesome. \n And it doesn't make her seem too evil.", "This is the Stage 3 theme. \n This one is so nostalgic... I'm sure those who are familiar with Touhou's older works will recognize it, but it sounds like a song I did a few years ago. \n I made it in the same way, so it's very nostalgic, but what good is it if it's only nostalgic to me? (Haha) \n This theme is a bit out of place. It has some of the 80s flavor in it.", "This is Kamishirasawa Keine's theme. \n It's both serious and mysterious. \n I really like the striking melodious feeling conveyed by the piano in the intro. \n To me, Japanese culture is sort of a natural progression in East Asia. \n So the soothing elements of Japanese music are never to be taken lightly.", "This is the Stage 4 theme. \n This song is an arrangement of the game's title screen theme. It's a nice tune with a very quick tempo. \n For the end, I put in a laughing sound, like that of a youkai. However, it's unnatural to hear it where it should not be creepy. \n Altogether, the rhythm is odd. I feel there's a hind to encroaching madness in it.", "This is Hakurei Reimu's theme. \n If you're wondering why this theme is nostalgic, it's an arrangement of a song from a few years ago. It's an arranged version of Reimu's Stage 4 boss theme from the fourth game, Lotus Land Story. The patterns in Stage 4 closely resembles those of Lotus Land Story, so I thought I'd do a similar song and give some people deja vu. \n The other theme for this game is \"An Old Memory Called Fantasy\".", "This is Kirisame Marisa's Theme. \n At this point, this song isn't all nostalgic or anything. It's an arrange of an old tune from the second game, Story of Eastern Wonderland. \n I was wondering if this theme still suited Marisa, and what shocked me is that it totally did. It's rare to see someone so unchanged. \n Marisa has 5 themes, but I think this one suits her best.", "This is the Stage 5 theme. \n Asian, Western, old, new-- This song isn't one or the other. The boss seems that way, too, but the stage itself is based in Japanese horror. \n Each song has a theme, and this one's based on the song \"Kagome, Kagome\". It's not an arrangement, just composed with a similar theme. \n I didn't want to get caged in on a theme for this one.", "This is Reisen U. Inaba's theme. \n When you think of a boss in the final stages of Touhou, this is what comes to mind. Guess some things never change. (Haha) \n After the wild intro, there's a mournful melody in the middle before the hook breaks through. \n Ah, all the characters look like they're having so much fun.", "This is the Stage 6 theme. \n The 20th century voyagers-- \n The Noah's Ark of the 20th century flew into space, carrying with it hopes and fears. \n However, it seems that just its hopes were left behind on the moon. \n Here in the \"future\", in the 21st century, only fears and a handful of illusions seem to be all that remain.", "This is Yagokoro Eirin's theme. \n Impossible courage, ferocity, and vigor-- \n This theme combines all of those, making for a ridiculously foolish and energetic song. \n All the energy and foolishness culminates in the final boss (really?), so the act itself of putting this song in a shmup is lunacy. \n I didn't want to get caged in on a theme for this one.", "This is Houraisan Kaguya's theme. \n Boy, she really is MAD, huh? (Haha) This song brings out a feeling of losing one's cool. \n I don't express emotions through songs, I make songs with emotions. And really, the game makes the songs. \n They're not very cool and modern, are they? (Haha) \n I'll admit I'm no pro.", "This is the Last Spell theme. \n All it inspires is a frantic feeling. It's seriously fast. \n It's the constant repetition of a short phrase that makes it so fast. \n That doesn't sound like my kind of morning. (Haha) \n Of course, it is fast, but it also has a mysterious kind of nostalgia.", "This is the Extra Stage theme. \n It's kind of relaxed for one, huh? \n It feels like a test of courage that wouldn't scare anybody. (No, it doesn't). \n I'm actually a little unsure about it, but it's extended. I collected E, X, T, E, N and D and extended it.", "This is Fujiwara no Mokou's theme. \n I tried to bring out as much intimidation, power and coolness I could that some shadiness came out. But even if the song isn't shady, the character certainly is. \n I always like kicking it old school for the Extra Boss song. This time around I really kicked it.", "This is the ending theme. \n It's still the same. All laid back. \n The ending song is never all that upbeat. And this one is no exception.", "This is the credits theme. \n I added a little nostalgia to this one. \"Maple\", such an old memory. This theme is loaded with old memories. But there's far too few staff.", "This is the Last Word theme. \n I wanted it to invoke feelings that deviate from the frame of the story. \n I'm not trying for coolness. \n I'm not trying for cuteness. \n I'm not even trying for creepiness. \n But it would be nice if it doesn't put you in a bad mood after listening to it for so long.",
  //Immaterial and Missing Power
  "The music for opening and title scene. Like other Touhou, it starts off gentle, and doesn't really pick up. I tried to enhance the value of existence with this opening theme I didn't plan to compose at first but managed to do at last. I hope you hear it at least one time. The key feeling of this song is \"This is what the Touhou world is like\".", "Based on Reimu's theme from Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream. I really liked the old FM synth music, too.", "Reimu's night-time theme. As the title says, it's an arranged version of \"Maiden's Capriccio\". It's used in the shrine, so I've arranged in the fake Japanese taste. Maybe. I'd already finished with this song before summer came, so when I listened to the \"Maiden's Capriccio\" from Imperishable Night, I wondered if maybe I messed up the parts I changed. Anyway, if I made it the same, my work would be just a poor copy, so I think it's okay this way.", "Based on Marisa's theme from Story of Eastern Wonderland. The atmosphere finally became calm. In \"Imperishable Night\", it will upgrade to \"Master Spark\" (the future tense).", "Marisa's theme in the night. I also call it ... \"The song where I eventually lost the original idea through continual remaking: Part 1\". I meant to have this played by people, but I never thought about that while writing it, so parts of it ended up being pretty hard to play. Well, that meant it was a pain for me to edit later, too. Anyway, it's unsightly to write about production difficulties. But I did it anyway.", "From the stage 5 theme in Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. It looks like the common theme is \"Maid = rock music\". My initial image was a North European metal rock piece, but it's just not hard enough.", "Sakuya's night theme. It feels like all the hard edges of the original were taken out; maybe it's too soft. It also has too many fabricated parts. I also wanted to play the guitar by myself if I could, but I ended up not being able to. I'd like to do another secret arrangement if I can.", "Based on the stage 3 theme from Perfect Cherry Blossom. The forest where Alice lives is dark both day and night. Alice has many kinds of dolls, so I wanted the song's atmosphere to change a lot, but it stayed pretty constant.", "Alice's night-time stage theme. This song has a five-beat rhythm and weird sounds stuck into it, so it ought to fit the character's performance pretty well. But because I tried to throw in so many unusual elements, eventually I noticed the parts that made the original song great were gone. Hmm. This has nothing to do with the music, but I don't think the 2P color is quite right.", "Based on Patchouli's theme from Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. The original song is pretty dark, but Pache looks pretty energetic in IaMP. (She even goes outside.)", "Patchouli's night-time stage theme. This is for the night-time stage, but it's actually brighter than the daytime stage because of all the lights, so I made it louder. As a result, it turned into the Exciting, Ever-Moving Great Library. The latter half retains elements of the original, though even I cannot recognize very much.", "Theme of Youmu from Perfect Cherry Blossom. The setting is a graveyard, so this song feels like there's nothing left to hold onto. By the way, I prefer \"meido\" (maids) to \"meidou\" (the Netherworld). (Hee)", "Youmu's theme in the night. The melody of the original song comes through pretty easily this time. The intro part isn't that great for fighting game music, but maybe it will work out if the music changes while the pre-battle conversation is still going on.", "Based on Remilia's theme from Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. I tried to use the second half of the original theme. It may be too hard for humans to play the guitar part, but it's probably okay for youkai, right? (Like maybe those three sisters.)", "Based on Yuyuko's theme from Perfect Cherry Blossom. The assumption here is that midnight isn't very peaceful. But it ended up as a daydream...", "Theme of the battle just before the feast in Story Mode. However, the character this plays for depends on the character you control. This song depicts the suspicion and anger of the heroine building up until it eventually explodes. The song is all introduction except the final short main part.", "This is the theme of Yukari. I think the combination of ominous and nice parts suits Yukari's personality well. And I wonder if I've finally written a song that doesn't mix Eastern and Western styles together, but expresses them separately. I shouldn't combine East and West for Yukari. After all, if I don't keep them separate, then there's no boundary.", "This is the theme of Suika. There're plenty of fairy tales for children like Momotarou, Issunboushi, Kintarou, etc. I wanted to make a song that would fit well with that sort of fun-loving, happy oni. That sort of fearlessness is irresistable. Anyway, there's a story that got left out of the ones I mentioned above; I wonder which it is? While we consider this, why don't we go drinking with an oni tonight, too?", "The music played at the ending scene. I can't help being a little sad after all the festivals end. During the summer and winter Comiket festivals I'm totally exhausted, and before I know it all three days have passed... (Time for the festival afterwards.)", "The music for the credits. I had a definite image for the opening (nevermind the results), so I basically did whatever I want with this song. There aren't many limits on the nature of the credits music. It's really great when the music matches with the words on the screen, but if it doesn't work because somebody forgot something it really sucks, it makes me want to cry. By the way, I played the melodion part myself.", "Scenario music. It sounds like music you'd hear playing where a bad person is. But it's so short ...", "Music for a scenario. It's not for use during dialogue, so it doesn't last very long. It's almost like sound effects.", "Music for a scenario. The title originally meant to go around training in different places, but it seems everyone's just going around making a ruckus ...", "Music for a scenario. It sounds like they don't know what to do.", "Music for a scenario. It sounds like a song that plays when you visit a suspicious person. Well, she has the most common sense in Touhou.", "Music for a scenario. Eastern wind brings cool in summer. The girls face this incident making a riot. The music expresses their anxiety whether they can solve the incident. Even so, it doesn't sound like Touhou.", "This was originally based on the opening theme, but it wasn't very interesting, so I changed a lot of things until it became something totally unrecognizable. I love the funny \"chupa-chupa\" sound.", "I thought it wouldn't be used, but it got slipped in some time, so I was surprised. All the music for conversation was composed before I really understood the details of scenario, so several pieces may not fit the scenes well ... that's my excuse.", "I wanted to make something mysterious. I wonder if it feels that way to you. It's pretty boring if you listen to this by itself, but I guess that's good for dialogue music. I think it suits that purpose well.", "This was also put in unexpectedly, so I changed some melodies and arrangements. I wanted to make the second half really serious-sounding. But it's long enough that a lot of people don't hear the second half.", "I think it ended up relatively BGM-like. I composed it with a feeling that the Touhou-like piano was faster like this. I cannot say \"Touhou-like\" except the part of the piano. This is the music that I wanted to compose the first part more carefully.", "The conversation theme of fighting game should be excited but calmer than that of the coming battle part... I thought like that at first, though I thoroughly ignored. It has no processes and is very simple. By the way, the code name was \"Iwao\".", "I needed something for the conversation, so I composed earlier. The strange melody is what I added later, but it may be a somewhat waste material. Even so, I prefer the melody like that.", "Theme for conversation that has a fake Japanese taste. I hope it excites you. It has only main-like part so as to understand easily.

But this is Gensokyo.", "Hakurei Reimu's theme. \n I tried to write this one so you would feel spring itself through the piece. Not purely Japanese, but more like Touhou style. \n I thought it'd be good to not have it wear down on people during long battles, so I controlled its intensity, but compared to other, more intense pieces, it seems pretty sedate. Like Reimu?", "Kirisame Marisa's theme. \n The way I first composed this one made Marisa sound like a bad guy, so I added on a bit of playful antiquity to it. \n In doing so, that antiquity gave it a hind of Middle Eastern flair, which could be a problem. However, given th nature of this game, I'd like to believe this properly reflects the endless stream of action and suspense that happens.", "Izayoi Sakuya's theme. \n Since all of Sakuya's pieces from Embodiment of Scarlet Devil were all very hard and driving, I tried to make this one more human, or more fitting for a first stage. \n I can't explain why I don't think this melody fits, but how about you? \n What's weird to me is that if you think it's going to be an Asian piece, it sounds like it, but treat it as Western and it sounds like that too. If you think it's childlike, it's childlike, and if you think it's more mature, it sounds that way. Am I the only one who thinks so?", "Konpaku Youmu's theme. \n It's not the Perfect Cherry Blossom version, but the arranged vesion recorded in Ghostly Field Club. It draws out the coldness of the land of the dead. \n I used the boss themes for other characters, but here, I thought this one fit Youmu well, so I used it. Rather, I liked this one.", "Reisen Udongein Inaba's theme. \n I made a few tweaks to the original to make it a little more nostalgic. I had my reasons for the original, but for this game, it may have been a little too much. Almost like \"why's it so serious?\" Well, Imperishable Night's pieces were all just a little too much. \n Because it was about night and time... \n Well, maybe that doesn't make any sense. Could you say this one's about flowers and idiots... (oops)", "Cirno's theme. \n The old stupid^H^H^H^H^H^H cute song has become cool. It's weird how that worked, and it makes you wonder. \n Still, the melody itself seems pretty dumb. I wrote this in an Asian style, light and intense, not worrying about whether it fits the image of a little girl. Instead of Asian, it feels more Touhou, and I seem to have developed a special pattern without realizing it.", "The three Prismriver Sisters' theme. \n I rearranged this piece to exude a lighter atmosphere than the original. Some time later, I want to make a piece that showcases the sisters performing solo. \n Lunasa on violin, Merlin on trumpet, piano and accordion for Lyrica mmakes sense in this piece, but if you think about it, who's playing the drums and keeping beat?", "The bird, er, rather, Mystia Lorelei's theme. \n It's now three strong 30% increase. \n It sounds up-tempo enough to drive someone insane, but that's its purpose. Mystia is enjoying the flowers herself. \n Mystia's song is said to bewilder people, but if you listen to this, it sounds like a pretty harsh song. Of course it'll drive people nuts. A punk youkai.", "Inaba Tewi's theme. \n I designed this to be a little playful, sentimental, and Japanese. \n How is it? It came out fairly easygoing and cute, and I think it fits Phantasmagoria of Flower View to a T. \n Actually, the notes and scales used aren't Japanese. If you were to ask me \"where's the Japan in it?\", I really couldn't tell you. But doesn't it seem Japanese?", "Shameimaru Aya's theme. \n This is the short version of the theme to Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red. The original peice was a long six minutes, but such long battles in this game cannot happen, so I took the main section and looped it. \n I imagined a wind god girl looking good playing the trumpet when I made this. \n A world where feelings fly on the winds. This is the image I had in mind for Phantasmagoria of Flower View.", "Medicine Melancholy's theme. \n Phantasmagoria of Flower View's most unique composition. I wrote it to be a little Western and fairly dark in image. \n This boss-like and strangely uplifting piece hints at older arcade games. \n The sound of bells at the beginning of the song is a strangely unsettling sound. This is poison.", "Kazami Yuuka's theme. \n I thought to create a piece bright and fluid, with the elegance of a flower. It didn't come out that way. \n The main melody here is done on piano, and particularly as I was writing it, it brought back fond memories. \n I thought it'd be better to make the piano part longer, but piano doesn't seem to fit the game all that well, so it's shorter.", "Onozuka Komachi's theme. \n To sweep away everything, and see what remains is the destiny of the mid-boss. This one reflects that fate, as well as the feeling of sweeping away. \n Touhou has done this sweeping idea in the past, but I feel like this is the first time I've put so much exhilaration and pathos into a piece. \n On the higan retour, that there would be no regrets as this piece...", "Shiki Eiki Yamaxanadu's theme. \n Obviously, a theme for a last boss. A melodious last boss theme is a Touhou trademark. This time, Japan + rebirth + country of cherry blossoms are the images I mixed together. \n This song full of strength and ephemerality is a song for the as-yet unseen most beautiful land of cherry blossoms. \n As silly as the whole game may be, this piece alone evokes strong feelings.", "The conversation theme. \n Though it's an edit of the title theme, it adds a little to the nervousness before a match. Maybe it makes it all that much more illusionary. \n If there was a problem, it's that there is no nervousness to speak of before a match. Something just seems wrong, from the beginning.", "The second conversation theme. \n As it's the end of the game, I prepared an element of impatience. \n Exceptionally short, it's not much to speak of. Well, at least it's a Touhou-sounding piece.", "The ending theme. \n I don't know... Touhou ending themes, in their entirety, always sound like bad endings. \n Could it be that clearing shooting games itself gives humanity a bad ending? (nah, no way)", "The staff roll theme. \n I thought about making a lighter staff roll than normal, but I regret making it both light and almost empty.

No, there's nothing wrong with your monitor or speakers, so relax.", "Photo theme 1. \n For this game, instead of the usual boss battle music, I wanted it to be more casual, so I wrote this. \n It has a very relaxed feel, because Aya is enjoying herself - as if she were teasing her target.", "Photo theme 2. \n It's easygoing enough to seem scary and cute. \n Though kidnapping and eating people is a youkai thing to do, this cheerfulness that must have come from somewhere is also part of the fabled tengu image. \n I think this piece mixes that scariness, cuteness, cheerfulness, and carelessness together.", "Photo theme 3. Written for the middle levels. \n While it feels like both the boss and Aya are having fun, it is hard to convey the feeling of the boss being coerced. \n This tune is aware of that, so while being light and bright, it was written to also bring out the strength of the boss. Especially the piano.", "Photo theme 4. Written for the latter half of the game. \n I feel, deep inside, that this hinks at retro Japan. \n Snow, falling in the capital. a deserted night road. \n But this retro is my idea of retro... \n Listening to this might make you reminisce.", "Photo theme 5. \n This is Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red's main theme, so I couldn't leave it out. \n Though this edit is rarely used :-)",

  //Perfect Memento in Strict Sense
  "The first of these new songs has a very heavy game music feel to it. \n It has very easy-to -follow phrases and a great rhythm. I have the feeling there just aren't that many songs like this anymore. \n Still, I really love this kind of song, so think that makes me feel a little lonely. \n May your life have more adventurous sagas!", "A bit of a curveball. The image in this song is a mysterious girl, something of a specialty of mine. \n I thought I'd give it a mysterious atmosphere, but it all cleared up by the main melody - see, a curveball. \n It sounds doubly nostalgic since listening to it reminds me of RPG dungeons, seriously.", "This is a song I improvised a long time ago, but since that makes it a sad song unlikely to show up in any albums, I did my best to clean it up for performance here. \n It was originally a song that just repeated over and over, so I gave it a melody that reveals more of itself over time as you listen to it.",

  //Eastern and Little Nature Deity
  "This is the theme of the sunlight fairy, Sunny Milk. I could easily use this song as it is in a game. If I were to make a game where they all appeared at once, this song would be the most suitable. \n It is indeed a song that feels like the theme of a boss in the first half of my games, casual and not too serious. The hook that feels like it's flowing backwards with its sparkling beeping sounds feels very much like Sunny. I like how the super-speedy bass and the unexpectedly Eastern-style melody match each other. However, everyone else seems to forcefully make it a point that it really wouldn't work in a game... \n By the way, Sunny's ability to refract light is also able to do so at negative refractive indexes. While no common substance is able to do this, it is said to be optimal for hiding oneself. \n Even rutile never stood a chance against Sunny's power.", "This is the theme of the moonlight fairy, Luna Child. \n Just the slightest bit serious. If I had to say, it would be used for a stage theme in a game. Among the main characters in this book, I would say that Luna had most of the better lines, but as a result of this, it's easy for the others to make fun of her. In other words, she has a very general personality that is easiest to understand. Those who are night-owls themselves will relate to her. \n In this song, I tried to combine the feel of the stories in this book, too. I was trying to create something that has a strange rhythm if you listen very, very closely. \n And then the title. I believe it to express the straightforwardness of fairies and their mindset. Hunams can't sleep although it's nighttime. Fairies sleep because it's nighttime. Youkai don't sleep because it's nighttime. \n And she can't sleep because it's nighttime, even if she's sleepy. The moonlight is too bright for her.", "This is the theme of the starlight fairy, Star Sapphire. It's sort of carefree and peppy. If I had to say, it would be an ending theme, but I couldn't use it like that. \n I made this song while envisioning someone enjoying a stroll at night while dancing with their hands underneath a starry sky. \n It's good to make things enjoyable, but at some points in the song it feels a little lonely. I guess it feels as if I made the song with the image of just the fairies with no one else around, but fairies wouldn't see something like that as lonely. Fairies always move on their own. The Three Fairies are simply an exception to this rule. That's how the song feels (Maybe not that far). \n Star usually takes an observatory standpoint when Sunny and Luna bicker, sometimes she will feign ignorance and say something that will completely change the mood. \n There are many things that are represented by stars: planets, comets, meteors and other kinds of heavenly bodies.",
  //Mountain of Faith
  "This is the title theme. \n The same song as ever... \n I tried to make it really majestic, as befitting for a Japanese-style God. \n It's a pretty queer and unusual rhythm, but it all comes through if you keep listening to it. \n Especially, say, while you're debugging the game.", "This is the first stage theme. \n It's been many days since I last used this kind of mood. \n Considering the melodious pard where the tempo suddenly drops, and the tune which doesn't really cause any tension... I think this is the song most befitting of a stage 1 of all the stages 1 and 2 songs in Touhou games up until now. What do you think?", "This is Aki Minoriko's theme. \n It has a pretty good tempo compared to the rest. I tried making it with the image of a harvest festival and an inexperienced and thoughtless god. \n The only game that can do with this kind of tension-less piece is Touhou. Normally, fighting a boss with this kind of music would be difficult. \n It's a short loop, but the boss fight itself is short anyway.", "This is the second stage theme. \n In contrast with the first stage, this is a gloomy piece. \n It combines both western and oriental styles; I think it has a nice feeling to it. \n The boss is a gothic lolita, so the music turned out his way. \n The transition from the mysterious intro to the chorus where your field of vision expands has a pretty good feeling to it.", "This is Kagiyama Hina's theme. \n Since she's a gothic lolita, I thought I should make it a more painful kind of feeling, but when I thought of my own preferences, and the matter of the entire game, this kind of feeling just settled in. \n Well, she's just a stage 2 boss. It's better to make her look a bit stupid.", "This is the third stage theme. \n It's the first tune you hear after infiltrating Youkai Mountain. It's bursting with the heavy verses of Gensokyo. I prepared the best melodious tune I could for the beautiful valley the youkai reside in. \n I hope I have managed to convey a rather liberal feeling, in contrast to the darker stage two theme.", "This is Kawashiro Nitori's theme. \n You will hear this song quite a bit, so I've put forth my best effort so that you won't get tired of it. For that purpose, I've used some strange phrases and rhythms, but I wonder if it was any good. My hypothesis is that you'll be listening to this one a lot. Since my first impressions of the song, as I continued to listen to it, it seems to have gradually changed on me. \n As the concluding piece, it should end up having a rather sorrowful sound to it, I guess?", "This is the fourth stage theme. \n When you think of waterfalls, there are two images: the powerful, vast waterfall and the meek, trickling one. \n But this time, I opted for the image of the former. Touhou has always, always had a dark feel to it, so I tried to express a somewhat refreshing feel. Why is that? \n An autumn waterfall. I think the thing waterfalls convey the most is autumn.", "This is Shameimaru Aya's theme. \n I made the same Aya's theme, Wind God Girl, witht he image of Aya the newspaper reporter, but this time I emphasised the image of the youkai \"Tengu\" from ancient Japan. \n If I somehow gave it an old, nostalgic feeling, you too would become one of the youkai. \n Ahh, it feels so nostalgic.", "This is the fifth stage theme. \n This time, the Japanese element is deep throughout. \n Especially as it gets more Japanese the more you progress through the latter half. \n Comparing this tune to the other, the Japanese element is relatively small, but the very dark, nostalgic melody and rapid chorus feel very latter half. \n If you listen to it combined with the gameplay, it feels even more latter half (well, it is the latter half). \n Even so, the Moriya Shrine seems even more extravagant than the Hakurei Shrine...", "This is Kochiya Sanae's theme. \n It feels like the metal section suddenly got bigger here; I thought I'd give this a heavy feeling, but I got careless and overdid it, which is a bad habit of mine. Tee hee. \n Whether it's the melody or something else, it's the heaviest in this game. From this point on, it suddenly becomes bright, and at the end it kind of lost its touch... \n The stronger they are, the less the feeling of tension: this is the promise in Gensokyo.", "This is the sixth stage theme. \n Since the stage is short, the tune is also short. The final stage has a drawn out Last Boss battle, so if I didn't make the path leading to it shorter, it would lose its potency, which is why it's short. I'm not omitting the vital steps. \n I tried expressing the feeling \"hey, something's about to start\" in this tune. \n Of course something's going to start, since it is the final stage after all.", "This is Yasaka Kanako's theme. \n This is a strange god who makes all human and youkai her friends with an overwhelming power. \n I composed a part which makes you feel awe towards a god, and a part which makes you feel the gravity of history. \n Anyhow, it's a playful tune which possesses ample reckless abandon. There's a huge difference compared to Sanae in the melody, but maybe this is the difference between gods and humans.", "This is the extra stage theme. \n I thought of writing the most cheerful piece for this game. \n Not especially tasty yakisoba, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and heavily seasoned gesoyaki. And unusually expensive. \n Served as a junk food snack platter, with cans of beer, all the while gazing at the grounds. \n I love that kind of festival day at the shrine. That's one of the ways of enjoy beer.", "This is Moriya Suwako's theme. \n It's a cheerful piece with a rapid feeling. Moreover, I tried to add a Japanese and childish feeling to the melody. It fits Suwako perfectly. \n Such a lively tune is on the contrary, actually a piano piece from hell. \n Again, this song has an abundance of chaos, even moreso than Kanako. \n You'd definitely think she was playing around with the shrine maiden, what with the particularly high speed piano.", "This is the ending theme. \n This time, there are many triple beats that permeate your whole body. I feel that things like triple beat match the Japanese-style game nicely. \n It asserts itself modestly without being too dark or too light. \n Made this way, it becomes an atmospheric piece, thus it's suitable for any scene.", "This is the Staff Cridits theme. \n Pray to the gods for rain, and rain will fall. It doesn't have any relevance to the actual story, but the simplest thing to understandas a god's blessing is rain, so... \n The wind god doesn't just make the wind blow like a tengu can; there's also a connection to the meaning of harvest gods. If you think of farming, you think rain. That's why it's rain.", "This is the Game Over theme. \n It's too lonely when the Game Over screen is silent, so I put this in. \n Oh, how mysterious, it's even more lonely, now. \n But why?",
