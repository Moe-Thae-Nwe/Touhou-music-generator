  //Story of Eastern Wonderland
  "The title theme. It's a pretty long song for a title screen, so the demo will start if you try to listen to the whole thing. \n So, what part of this is Eastern?", "The first stage theme. It (the atmosphere) sounds heavy. A lot of shmups have really upbeat first stage themes, and this song is, too, but it's so dark. Even though the story for this game is a joke, the music is so serious, and the enemies are so hard. \n I like that kind of mismatch.", "The stage 1 boss theme. I tried to make it feel as weak as possible. I think this song sounds a little oriental.", "The second stage theme, I actually wrote this quite some time ago, so I think it feels different than the other songs. Actually, I wrote this song envisioning the dawn, but there weren't any scenes like that in the game, so I'm using it for a night scene. I wanted it to contrast the first stage theme - day and night, light and darkness - but the first stage theme was too heavy. Mmmm~", "The stage 2 boss theme. I tried making something cool, but it's really short, isn't it?", "I wonder just where the World of Fantasies is? I don't think it's anywhere in outer space, but...", "The third stage boss theme. The boss suddenly gets strong in this stage. However, the song has a long loop, so about the time the main melody ends; the boss should be dead.", "The '~ni moe' in the title means burning, I think it's definitely different from moe~ The rhythm is unusual. In a word, strange. Ah, what's Oriental about this song, anyway~", "Marisa's theme. She's the strongest magical girl. I tried to make the song feel like something from an anime, but try as I might, I just couldn't make something that had that heroine feel to it (I'm still practicing), so I tried to make something strong and witchy. I think it feels a little oriental.", "This was going to be the title song. Now it's an uninteresting stage 5 theme. To tell you the truth, this is the first song I made in PMD, so it didn't go that well, but it's the only song that changes rhythm. (The only one?) Still, it's the song I'm most familiar with.", "Mima's theme. There are a few points that I think are promised to last boss themes. Needless to say, it can't be too light, it can't be too simple, and it has to be mysterious, among other things. Of course, that's my opinion, so others may not agree.", "This is the Extra Stage song. This song and the next are all, are you sure you want to keep going? Let's do our best to beat the next person with a no continue clear. (Easy is fine, too.) So, that's what the song is like. Yep. Uja uja...", "The theme for a certain girl genius. At the early par, it's deliberately meant to feel particularly cute. In later part, I intended to finish the song in a cool style. The song uses the same progression as Extra Love. Still, conversely, this song is... too strong (^^;", "The ending song. It's a little dark, but the ending isn't really dark at all.", "The staff roll song. I thought the staff roll song should be an upbeat song with strong rhythm, but... It's energetic, but isn't it a little too dark?", "I made this, intending for it to be the first stage theme, but... Since the early songs in Highly Responsive to Prayers were so dark, so I thought I'd make this one brighter, and it ended up like this. But, I threw it out (^^;;;;", "I was going to use this for stage 2. It's not bad, but... It felt half-hearted, so I threw it out.", "I had planned on using this for the staff roll , but... The rhythm is so light it's almost unthinkable now (^^;;; It has a rather fine pedigree, but it didn't balance well with the other songs in the game, so I threw it out.",
  //Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream
  "This is the title music. Suddenly it doesn't seem too Touhou-like, right? \n Even if I do say so myself, for someone who's made music with such an unsuitable atmosphere I don't look too worried, I've been thinking lately. \n But lately, maybe it's because I've become accustomed to such an atmosphere, or maybe I actually am in this kind of atmosphere. I feel my game has to be like this or it's no good. \n In any case, right from the beginning I'm already talking about music like this. Oh no!", "What should I talk about for this song? (lol) \n It's a pretty heavy song, isn't it? \n Why is the character select song for a game with such a silly story like this? \n Oh well, it's pretty short... (The song, the development time, and the comments.)", "The game's main character also happens to be a shrine maiden, but... \n Is this really a shrine maiden's song? Well, uh. That's. You see. \n But, I do like it. And it does have a rather oriental feel to it, and the melody is pretty nice. Right? (Begging)", "For those who don't know Mima, she was the last boss from the last game, Story of Eastern Wonderland. \n This time, she's not a boss or anything, just a normal character, so I tried not to make her theme song too badass... \n You know, I just don't get her personality at all. \n (Even though she's my own character *sweatdrop*) \n Well, what about the song. The melody for the main chorus part is very simple, but feels really nice... Doesn't it? (Maybe because it's simple?)", "For those who don't know Mima, she was the last boss from the last game, Story of Eastern Wonderland. \n This time, she's not a boss or anything, just a normal character, so I tried not to make her theme song too badass... \n You know, I just don't get her personality at all. \n (Even though she's my own character *sweatdrop*) \n Well, what about the song. The melody for the main chorus part is very simple, but feels really nice... Doesn't it? (Maybe because it's simple?)", "Yeees. The composer is not too good at cute songs. This song doesn't seem very cute, does it? \n (If anyone knows the comic Ellen came from... sorry, it doesn't match her very well, does it?) \n Well, anyway, this song is actually a song I wrote a loooooong time ago to practice MIDI; I rewrote it all in FM. \n It was one of my favorite original songs, but it was completely Oriental-style, and... (I think this song is, too ...) I don't know how it ended up being a foreign girl's theme.", "She's a strange character. It's a strange song. Yes. \n What to say, what to say .... yeah. \n Well, I guess the high-speed xylophone-like sound is the main attraction for this song. \n Anyway, the melody's pretty weird. Do you all think so too? I knew it.", "She isn't human, either... \n When I'm making up characters, I'll write down a bunch on paper, and just choose some. This character has a pretty loli feel about her, but... \n The song is unusually cool. \n I said this before, but I'm not that good at making cute songs. This song turned out the same way... \n A cuter song would have been nice for this character... \n Aahhhh, all the songs feel kind of half-assed~ (It's cool, but it's got kind of girly instrumentation in it... ) Oh, well, it's okay. I guess I like this kind of song, after all.", "I like this song quite a bit, I really do, but it doesn't really fit the character at all, does it (^^; \n Oh well. This song's loop is pretty long, but it's pretty repetitive. \n Let's see, but, aside from the bosses, isn't it the coolest of the seven characters' themes? (Especially the main part, and even the intro)", "This song doesn't play in VS mode. Who the 7th is depends on which character you picked, but this song plays no matter who that was. So, if it's someone like Ellen, then this song will be totally out of place (^^; \nI was going for a boss feel, not a last boss feel, but... \n The main melody is almost the same as Reimu's theme. \n The main part is pretty cool... ...right? Well... maybe it's kind of odd?", "The demo is a little too long, isn't it? \n Honestly, since this song is so short, it has to loop a few times. \n Well, it seems like all the songs in this game are strangely cool ... \n By the way, if you press ESC during the demo, you can speed through it. If you press it twice, you can skip through it. Since it's a pretty pointless scene.", "This is the theme for the mid-boss who I don't know why she's there (^^; \n I was also going for a boss theme, not a last boss theme, but. Ummm. \n This is the only song in the game that's sycned up with the STAGE 8 START display. Did you notice? \n Well, anyway, that's a real sailor uniform. Er, ahh~", "This is pretty short. Still, I tried to give it that certain feeling. Well, that's about it.", "Well, I guess this is the last boss theme. I had a hard time with this one. Well, it turned out, so I guess it went well in the end. Since all the other characters' songs were pretty cool, I worked hard at this one. I ended up using a guitar-like sound, which I don't do often. And, the main part(?)'s melody was supposed to be really high-class, but. Maybe it's not?", "It's very ending-ish, but does it really match the ending scenes? 　Well, it's short.", "The song that plays during daytime endings. \n It definitely makes me think of shrines. Actually, this is the most shrine-maiden-ish song here, isn't it? \n See, doesn't this kind of song always play for shrines and shrine maidens in eroge? (lol)", "The song that plays during night-time endings. All the endings have a particular oriental feel to them. Hooray!", "Somehow it doesn't seem to fit the game at all either ... oh well. \n Still, I think this song works well as a staff roll song. \n It's cool, isn't it? Even if I'm the only member of the staff (lol) \n Maybe I put in too many weird parts~", "I remember finishing making this in no time at all. Well, it is a simple melody.", "", "", "I used this as I was building the game system before I made any characters. \n There weren't any characters that really fit this song, so I tossed it.", "A very spacey(?) song. \n I don't make many songs like this one. It's the only one that really seems like it's a STG song, but (because of that?) I tossed it. \n (Because there aren't any characters that fit this song!)", "For some reason, this song that actually has a pyramid feel to it got tossed. \n I wonder what kind of character would go with this song?",
  //Lotus Land Story
  "It's the usual. And we've just about had them enough already (^^;; \n I wonder what makes a song Japanese-styled. \n Hm, well, I do like the song itself quite a bit, but... \n Not much else, aside from the fact that it doesn't really match the title screen (^^;;; \n Well, I suppose even that (not matching the title picture) is a trademark of this series (^^; (Not really)", "Weeell. This song turned out kind of a pretty cool one. But, it might be a little too dark. \n There's that drum pattern in the second half that's almost out of desperation. Just a little. \n Yep. Ah, well.", "This is a pretty cute song, isn't it? \n I guess the kind of cute that you'd say fits a witch girl? (No way, it's definitely not.) \n I always write my songs pretty haphazardly, so I never really have any idea how they'll turn out. \n I do seriously put some thought into the theme, but... \n (By the way, this is a pretty cute song (^^;)", "The first boss song is pretty hard. It's popular for boss music nowadays to be dignified, but as you can see, most of the bosses in this series are cute girls, so I try to make their songs cool. \n So, why are the first boss songs hard, well, it's actually pretty easy for me to make a cool (sounding) song most of the time (I think). But, if the first stage boss theme is really cool, I don't have anything left over for the rest of the songs, and end up making something really weird - that's my pattern. \n So, it's a pretty serious problem. Well, what do you think of this song? (^^;;", "The patterns in this song are similar to those from last time. \n It starts bit-by-bit and goes pah-pa pah-pa (mysterious) \n It was actually pretty easy to make, so it didn't leave a strong impression (^^;", "My boss songs are basically short. If they're long, you might not be able to hear the whole thing. (^^; \n I was going for a song that would evoke the image of a westernized demon, but... ? \n Well, it has a nice feel (^^", "This song feels like my older songs. \n Well, since it started turning out weird, I did try to make it at least sound like something I might have written long ago ... \n It's nice to have something this rhythmical(?). And, it's very 3rd-stage-ish(??)...", "I kind of like this song. \n The stage 3 boss is kind of strong. The song has the same feel to it. \n She may look strong, but the song gives you the feeling you'll definitely win(?)", "I imagined a cool-looking Western-style mansion while making this song, and it ended up turning into something I really don't understand (^^; \n But, I think it has an altogether different atmosphere from the the other songs... \n (Or maybe it's the same (^^;;;)", "Yeah. I really like this song. \n The biggest problem, is no matter who listens, it's just not a shrine maiden song at all (^^; \n But, I think this song best expresses the atmosphere of this game. \n It's a little cute, too.", "It's hard to make weirder songs than this. \n The intro has a kind of boss-ish feel to it. \n It has a bit of a somber feel to it. \n (Hm, I wonder, yeah)", "I had no idea what this was when I made it, but it's grown on me now. \n Once you get used to it, you can see how it's quite cool, and how it has quite a nice feel. Quite. \n The stage is short, too, so in-game the song only loops once. Poor thing.", "I'm usually pretty haphazard in my song writing, but this time I pretty much had the thing all planned out (in my head) before I got started. \n I don't think I use this type of bass pattern very often, though. \n But, I didn't have many voices in the 26 version, so it didn't come out all that well (;_;", "This is a very short song (^^; \n I think it came out very lonely-sounding, too (^^;;; \n Well, in any case, is it, I wonder? \n Kind of. Uja~", "The last boss theme. It has a very final feel to it. \n I think it came out pretty cool somehow~ \n Nobody really knows if Yuuka herself is cool. \n Personally, I think I rather like her.", "I made this one fairly rhythmical (not) \n The main part is pretty simple, so it feels nice. I get the feeling listening to it that this is how my songs are most of the time. \n I like songs like this, but sometimes I want to write something with a different atmosphere.", "The younger sister, Mugetsu's, theme. Somehow, she looks like a maid. \n This is a pretty cool song, isn't it? Even though it's short. (Because it's short?) \n Well, in any case, it turned out to be a pretend-maid song like this.", "The theme for the older sister Gengetsu, the most terrible, most fearful boss. I wanted for it to have a real Western feel to it, but ... ? \n I was aiming for a song that was pretty similar to Mugetsu's theme. \n Rather, I was really hoping to come up with a Mr. Dracula sort of song ... (;_;", "Hmm. It's a song that feels like there's no reason for hopes or dreams. \n At least when I know I can't make bright songs, the bad end song will come out well. \n Except the good end feels like a bad end, too.", "Huh, it feels kind of peaceful. \n Maybe ... a little bright?", "Well, the staff roll is kind of cool, after all. (Is that all you can say? (^^;) \n It seems like a very simple song, but it might actually be a very simple song. \n Well, there's very little staff, so I don't really need a long staff roll song (^^) \n For some reason, it's a lot like a boss song (^^;;;", "Seems like there should be a game over song, too. \n Yeah. Maybe a little too energetic.", "I was going to use this as the stage 1 theme. \n But, I thought it was a little too light, so I didn't use it...", "I was going to use this as the stage 4 theme. \n I thought it was kind of air-headed, though, so I threw it out. \n But, maybe it's not that bad?", "I was going to use this as the stage 5 theme. \n But for some reason I threw it out. (laugh) \n It's pretty nice, too ...", "I was going to use this as the stage 6 theme. \n I thought the last stage theme should be a bit more mellow, though, so I threw it out.", "I was going to use this as the extra stage theme. \n But I thought the extra stage song should be a little lighter, so I cried and cried and threw it out.", "I was going to use this for the staff roll. \n It's not STG-esque, though, so I threw it out.",
  //Mystic Square
  "The usual title theme. \n This is the song that really determined the direction of the rest of the game's music. \n Not bad, huh?

(^^;; \n This has way too much grit (lol). \n I probably could've done more with it, though...", "It has a pretty good Makai feel about it, doesn't it? \n The stage 1, 2 and 3 songs all turned out with a real sense of speed. \n Since it's Makai, I think it feels more western... hmm.", "If you listen carefully (?), it's pretty dark. ^^; \n I think the third stage boss of a shmup is a significant turning point, so I put some extra spirit into the making of this song. \n Well, it's not like I was slacking on the other songs or anything... (^^;;;)", "This ended up a pretty calm song all of a sudden. \n (Really, though?) \n This was a pretty hard song to make. \n But for what it's worth, it turned out pretty cool. \n (Didn't it?)", 'I was going for something simple, yet cool in this song. \n This song is closest to the songs from the last game. \n It was really easy to finish compared to "Maple Wise". (^^;;', "The melody somehow feels like something out of Story of Eastern Wonderland. \n All I can really remember is before I knew it, the song was done. \n It's kind of like something from my older games.", 'Compared to "Crimson Maiden", this one is a bit more musical. I figured she should be strong, since it\'s the 4th stage, so I gave this song that type of feel. (Which is?)', "I think I managed to make it feel pretty endgame-ish this time. \n Hmm, it's pretty cool, isn't it? \n I really like it(^^)", "This was a tough one. It has the most complex chord progressions I've ever done. \n I think this is the first song I worked all day to finish. \n I wanted to make this song pretty dark, so this is how it came out. \n I like this song a lot, so I hope you'll listen to it.", "The stage is just there for you to collect some items before the final boss, so it's pretty short. \n Actually, I wanted to try to do this with just a heartbeat sound, but this isn't that kind of game (lol)", "This is the last boss theme. Of course, I really put a lot of spirit into it. \n I was trying to make a song that had the right blend of coolness and cuteness. \n The main melody is pretty easy to remember, so it has a nice feel to it. \n Overall, I'm pretty fond of it.", "Fairy tale-esque and cool is what I was going for this time. \n Well, it's probably not fairy tale-esque, but it's pretty coooool. \n You have to dodge lots of bullets in the game, so you probably can't listen to it too closely, though. (lol)", "Compared to my other extra stage boss themes, this has heavy emphasis on the rhythm. \n No matter how cheap their attacks are, emerge victorious with a superior groove (^^;;", "It sounds like all my other good endings, but it's the bad ending. (lol) \n Well, I guess that's just because all my good ending themes were kind of dark.", "We've got unusually forceful ending themes this time. (lol) \n But it's very shrine-like. (^^;", "I wanted to make something like a piano solo, but... \n Yeah... (lol) \n It totally ends right in the middle, though...", "It's a very short song. \n Still, it's because I wanted to match what was happening on the screen with the music. \n In other words, it means there isn't much staff (so the staff roll is short). (lol)", "I figured I'd do a nice, rhythmical Japanese piece as rehabilitation. \n The rehabilitation failed. (lol) \n But I really like the song.

  "It's, well, game music-ish.

(Laughs) \n I do have original works, but since I make music for Touhou, too, it all kinda feels 'original'... \n Well, I guess they're more like unused tracks rather than original one.

(^^; \n Right now, I've started making songs for Touhou-related things again. (^^;; \n This song is a strange one, but I like it, too.

That would've been nice, but then it didn't really sound like a song for shooters, so I took it out. \n The song itself was really close to the image that I originally had... \n But that means, the image that I had wasn't fit for a shooter in the first place. (laught) \n But it's rather to my likings. \n the image for the song I had in mind was starting as easy listening and moving to jazz-fusion. There are lots of good Japanese-made jazz out there too (unless they try of mimic songs from foreign artists.) \n On a side note, when I used this song as an Extra stage track, I couldn't dodge the mid-boss' attacks.

Well, at least I tried (^^; \n For the first time in a while, I was able to finish the song before entering it into the computer, so I was able to finish it very quickly (lol)", "This is the theme of the second stage bosses, Mei & Mai. \n Anyway, I figured it would be nice to have this turn out with a real child-like feel to it as I wrote it. \n It didn't really turn out the way I thought it would, but I think the result is still all right. \n It's a song that I got to make as little-girl-ish as I wanted, but maybe all my songs have been like that (lol)", "This is the third stage theme. \n Personally, this feels like something I don't usually write. I thought it would be nice if it had a kind of endless atmosphere while I was writing it, but... \n And it's unusual for me to write an unusual pop theme, so this is a very unusual song. I think it's nice for games to have a particular accent to them... \n But, is this really pop? (lol)", "This is the theme of the stage 3 boss, Gates. \n Well, he's a male character, so I was lost on how to create an appropriate theme (^^; And he's military. I don't have much experience with military things, so it was all to mysterious. \n So, of course, I just went about business as usual (^^; I really did want to give it my all... \n Even though I say it's magical-girl-ish, it seems to be popular *sweatdrop*", "This is the stage 4 theme. \n Space, now I'm mega lost (lol) The dissonance right from the start makes it space music (no way!) \n It really feels like super old game music, I think... \n This also feels kind of like pop music, and even though I always wrote dark songs like this for Touhou, it has kind of a mysterious feel to it. \n (Huh? Isn't this kind of upbeat, too? *sweatdrop*", 'This is the theme of the stage 4 boss, Marie. "Here it comes!" is how this song feels to me. The melody and atmosphere are just like the songs I wrote for Touhou. \n Anyway, it\'s not too fast, and it\'s pretty cool, so I\'m quite satisfied with this song. \n Even so, the melody is pretty simple and easy to remember. Maybe it\'ll get stuck in your head during the boss fight.', "This is the stage 5 theme. \n I finished this before the level data was done, so from here on it's all just awesome battles (lol) \n In any case, since it's a maid game, it's Western, since it's Western, it's gotta be Western style. \n I don't think you even get to hear once through a loop in the game, but the chorus isn't that Western, anyway (^^;", "This is the theme of the stage 5 boss, Erich. \n Man, this song is just awesome! Of course, it's fantastically awesome. \n At this point, there's really no difference between this and Touhou music (lol) \n Touhou was pretty much full of songs like this (^^;", "The stage 6 theme. \n All my other last stage songs before now have been slow tempo songs, but this time I made something that's more medium. \n The theme of this song is a fighting maid. \n ...Wait, then what about the other songs? (^^;", "This is the first theme of the last boss, Vivit. \n I tried making it without any feeling of finality or being the last. \n It feels like the intro for the last boss. \n It's amazingly unlike shooting game music (lol) \n The main theme from this song was originally something I produced for the title screen, but I'm using it here. Afterall, it feels a lot like a demo song. (oh", "This is the second theme of the final boss, Vivit. \n I made it to be fantasy techno (woah!) Since it's effectively an intermediate piece, I took care not to make it too assertive. I don't make this kind of song that often, so it's really become a favourite of mine. \n To tell the truth, I wanted to make this mostly a percussive song, but I haven't listened to a lot of songs like that, so it didn't come out as well as I wanted, and I eventually added a melody.", "The final boss, Vivit's third theme. \n this is definitely a song that's bursting through with an air of finality, isn't it? \n Western-style music is fun~. Well, at least it feels western to me. \n It would have been nice if I could have gotten all the songs to be a little more like that. \n (Hey, now.)", "The Extra stage theme. \n I tried making a Touhou-esque song for once. It's Japanese style and new-agey, and uses Japanese instruments. \n Japanese instruments and piano go together very well. Like maybe hichiriki and piano (like Hideki Togi)... \n Anyway, I'm sure various instruments must have travelled the silk road, bringing with them various fantasies. Our maid heroine must also travel the silk roa- (abridged)", "This is the heme of Kirisame Marisa, the first Extra boss. \n A witch's theme. ...It sure doesn't fit her. (lol) \n It really feels like a bad guy's theme. Well, it's a boss theme, so I guess it is (^^; \n I wanted it to come through with a feel of intelligence rather than cuteness, but is that how it turned out?", "This is the theme of Hakurei Reimu, the second Extra boss. \n A shrine maiden who boasts ultimate attack power. I tried to go for a shrine maiden theme with this song. ...Well, not at all, really. (^^; \n Since it's the end, it feels like it's got a sense of speed and a sense of something else~ (lol) \n It's too bad I couldn't come up with a song that gave our shrine maiden a feel of intelligence. Anyway, take care to dodge all the bullets...", "The ending theme. \n Sadness, hope, courage, and then, again, sadness... \n ...Is how it came out, but it was a lot of work. \n There's so much going on with so many styles in just a minute and a half that it may be hard to keep track of. \n The intro is like something from an eroge (wrong!) \n The main melody helps lift up your spirits (somehow) \n The main melody is like the cavalry coming in (wrong again) \n And the end is based on the ticking of a clock (really) \n I worked so much on it, but it's so short~ (^^;", "The name register screen theme. \n This isn't a \"game over\" theme, but for some reason, it's so dark it doesn't make you feel like playing again (lol) \n I'm glad you'll all play the song, but I'm sorry for letting loose with something so dark (^^; \n This gloom isn't the gloom of pathos or longing. In a word, maybe it's despair? (^^;", "",

  "The title theme. A strange song like never before. \n I really don't think there needs to be a song for a motionless title screen, but since it'd feel lonely without it, I always have a song for the title. \n But I feel as if it feels lonelier with the song. (^^;", "VIVIT's theme. \n When thinking of a maid, people get the image of a girl with glasses who's weak to sunlight, but this time, I made this song with my image of a maid. \n Well, it always happens, but... \n I'm pertty sure this isn't an Asian style of song. (^^;", "Gates' theme. \n It sounds so girlish that it's almost scary. \n Well, everything's by my taste. But perhaps I made this too calm (^^;", "Mei & Mai's theme. \n Things suddenly sound mature now (^^; \n These difficult to remember melody lines are something that I like.", "Milia's theme. \n This is the oldest song I made. About a year ago. \n The point of this song (or not) is that, most of the song's on piano, and yet there are parts that don't feel like that at all.", "Marie's theme. \n I thought this song would be the biggest mismatch, but it looks like it ended up matching the character. It sounds heavy, and yet the rhythm runs light and smooth. \n There's a really hard to explain sort of feel in this song (^^;", "Erich's theme. \n Hahaha, now isn't this amazing (lol) \n I wanted to make this to an old man's image, but it became a gentle book-loving girl's song. \n In the first place, it doesn't even sound like a song for a STG (^^;", "Yuuka's theme. \n It's Japanese style. Itd be lonely to have a game without an Asian sort of song. (laughs) \n It's a light and fun song, which is very rare for me (no, really). \n It's quite fasionable (really?)", "Morgan's theme. \n Finally, a song that fits a boss battle. \n It might be the most me-ish song this time. \n As you can see from the title (nope), I played this song while I was flipping through a strategy guide for Valkyrie Profile since I was lost for an image for the song. (^^;", "Muse's theme. \n I don't know if it sounds like a last boss song, but it's a last boss song that sounds quite trendy. (^^;",

  "The title theme. \n It's Japanese-feeling, because it's Touhou (Eastern). No, really. \n However, it's not like the game is (^^; \n This doesn't sound like a shooting game piece. \n For that matter, is having a song on the title screen even necessary at all? (laughs)", "Stage 1 theme. \n The image of a midnight forest. As it's the first stage, I aimed for something a little energetic, so hopefully people would get into it. \n But isn't it something a little more comical and hectic?", "Rumia's theme. \n Not just this, but all the music this time is meant to be light. \n This comes from an image of youkai of the night \n ...or, at least, I hope so (^^; \n It's fairly relaxed and a little silly.", "Stage 2 theme. \n I thought of water and mist, and mixed an omen or two. \n In many ways, it resembles the feel of older titles. \n I don't really know why there's a Stage 2 anyway.", "Cirno's theme. \n I actually did think of a dim-witted girl for this. \n However, I don't know if what came out can be considered bright or dark. The tempo is pretty fast, but... \n Well, it's stage 2. (ha)", "Stage 3 theme. \n I intended to make it more Chinese, but it didn't quite work out. (^^; \n However it's still Oriental, because I knew it would be hard to put Oriental songs past stage 4 (^^; \n It's more New Age rather than Fusion, I guess?", "Hong Meiling's theme. \n A hint of Europe, mixed with game music a (2:8 ratio) \n It's strange that it's not more Chinese, but that's because it's composed with the image of the French settlement in Shanghai in mind. \n But, Meiling looks like she's not human. Then what is she... (eh)", "Stage 4 theme. \n From here, the game moves indoors, so it's composed with indoor atmospheres in mind. Its tone shifts to something more ominous halfway through the song, where you would normally meet the mid-stage boss. \n Other than that, there's nothing special about this theme, but really, it's not a shooting game piece (laughs)", "Patchouli Knowledge's theme. \n Again with this sick feeling... \n It's a dark song, without any light or bright moments, despite its quite fast-paced nature. \n It could stand to be a little less heavy, as listening to this piece could drag someone down (laughs)", "Stage 5 theme. \n A very mysterious song. Its unusual beat toys with your sense of speed, sometimes seeming to go faster. \n I was trying for a rock piece, but as I don't listen to rock much, it's quite possible that I have no idea what I'm doing (^^;", "Izayoi Sakuya's theme. \n You can't have a maid without hard rock (jk) \n It's quite driving, fitting for the second-to-last stage. \n ...Guess I still don't know much about rick (^^; \n Let's just call it 'private, poetical rock'.", "Final stage theme. \n The final stage themes have always been loaded, so I made it upbeat this time. As the final stage itself is quite short, I made this piece not as assertive.", "Remilia Scarlet's theme. \n With this, I tried for a \"This is the end!\" feeling. \n I didn't want it to be regal or ominous, which is normal for a final stage, so I made it Jazz-Fusion based with a hint of loli... wait, that's not any different than normal. \n Its melody is easy for even me to get, so I like this song.", "Extra stage theme. \n Sometimes it's Chinese, sometimes it's New Age. Why? \n This is what happens after messing with my keyboard. \n It's like an accumulation of my laziness. If you listen closely, there are many strange rhythms in this song. In other words, my toy-box.", "Flandre Scarlet's theme. \n I liked this one the best out of the whole game. It depicts a devilish girl in am Oriental and mysterious way. \n Loli-tastic melodies like this are what I'm best at, so I had a lot of fun composing this.", "Ending theme. \n As you can guess from its name, this is an arranged version of the title theme. So it's also in a Japanese style. \n Well, not that there's anything wrong with that.", "Staff Roll theme. \n The staff roll has always been dark and desperate, so I made it a bit more happy and hopeful this time. I think. \n As the staff list is always short, I couldn't write a long piece. I could have made it more magnificent, but it ended up a little dry. That was not my intention (Laughs)",

  "The title theme, strongly influenced from the previous one, all in a Japanese style. This song completely removes any hint of the upcoming storm of danmaku. Frankly, I think this song isn't necessary, but it's also meant to restrain the player's excitement for danmaku. (lol)", "As the title implies (for nothing at all to be there), this theme was composed with an image of nature that has yet to be discovered by humans. However, I personally didn't want it to be healing music, oddly enough, so I made it somewhat rhythmical. But it doesn't feel invigorating at all. (^^;", "A goal of my music is to subtly blend Japanese and Western elements together (applies to the other songs too). This one is short because it's the theme for the stage 1 boss, but I managed to express my image of the realm in this theme. While the song is direct, it's a strange one that doesn't fit into any music genre.", "This song is a weird one. Yeah. My original intent with this was to make it highly folkish, but since it's too calm, it ended up half-folkish. I composed this with the image of Tono village in mind. The melody is a bit nostalgic and makes you imagine that there used to be old villages like this in Japan, too.", "I composed this title with the image of an energetic youkai girl in mind. This song is based purely on improvisation, because I found that if I think too much while composing the music tends to end up strange. Well, with the help of more than a little booze... All in all, this is an honest song (^^;", "This makes you wonder if you're near the end of the game. This is because the demo was released very early and I had to finished it so it would be ready in time. Due to that, I put the first pivotal moment in stage 3. The mood is more serious than usual, too. However, that means it's similar to my older tunes. It might be just me, but this song gives a nostalgic feeling.", "Alice is kind of a special character in this series, so I composed the theme with renewed vigor (not that I was lazy with the other songs). This theme's goal is to show that the characters' peace of mind despite the intensity of the fight. This peace of mind shows their virtue in my opinion... (the virtue is) not the gothic-lolita costumes, I swear (haha).", "The style is more Chinese than Japanese. A wonderful place above the clouds. As the true beginning of this game, stage 4 is far longer than the others. There's never been such a stratospheric (it's not that high) intrusion with violent yet sorrowful music, has there? While I composed it with \"Journey to the West\" in mind, it doesn't resemble that.", "I tried to make this theme sound like it was being performed brightly and joyfully. A performance by happy-go-lucky sisters who love festivals and anything noisy. At the climax, each of them play their violin, trumpet and keyboard as they please. A veritable hodgepodge.", "This theme expresses the nostalgia that is deep within every Japanese and the frantic feeling that arises when someone is approaching. The sounds of far-off Shinto flutes and bells conjure up images of the netherworld. Or maybe it's just me?", "I tried to give the impression of both \"A Tough Opponent\" and \"Childishness\" with this theme. Perhaps this is the most boss-like theme in this game. While it uses guitar, I gave up trying to make it sound like rock music almost immediately. The hook's melody resembles the youkai.", "The final stage is all about the final boss, so the mid-stage is only a token effort. Because of that, this song is rather short, but it's also refreshing and pleasant (in my opinion). The stage has visual imagery of flying over a sea of cherry blossoms; I hope this song will give you the same impression.", "I gave this theme an oriental and melodious feeling while making it the \"final\" song. Having said that, the style of music is my usual fare. (lol) Vehement yet elegant, powerful but ephemeral; I thought I'd make this theme quite emotional.", "An arranged version of Yuyuko's theme. I put more emphasis on the mysterious atmosphere in this one. However, the melody itself is so harsh that it's almost tiresome. (lol)", "A high-paced theme (?) which is unusual in the Touhou series. It's obvious from the stage that the tempo and feel are the keys to this song. The tone turns around about 112 degrees in the middle of the song which is where Extra really starts (heh)", "I composed it to be more dazzling than fantastic. Hopefully you'll get the sense of the energetic youkai from the song. In my opinion, when there's a long fight in a shooting game, the music should repeat and sustain its tempo. That is, it should be like this theme.", "Another version of Spiritual Domination. It's not that different from the original though...", "Meant to be an arranged version of Ran's theme, it ended up quite different. this one has an ominous feeling. Or rather, she's the very embodiment of ominous. Even compared with the past characters, she has a devious appearance, a dubious character and thoughtless danmaku. The theme's just like her: devious (lol).", "The ending theme. ...It's just, it feels kind of dark. \n It's supposed to represent a peacful, everyday life, I swear.", "The imagery is based on the familiar song \"Sakura, Sakura\".

Please listen to the WAV if possible. There's an element of fantasy that just isn't in the MIDI.", "This is the stage 2 theme. \n You're in a hurry, but there's no pressure; rather, it feels like there's still plenty of time left. That's the kind of atmosphere I tried to create with this song. \n It was meant to be my take on the ultimate blend of the Japanese and Western styles. \n On an unrelated note, the girls in Gensokyo have no sense of danger. They're just enjoying their lives to the fullest...", "This is Mystia Lorelei's theme. \n She's just a Stage 2 boss, but this song makes her sound like a powerful foe. \n The theme has nothing to do with mystery of birds or night or anything weird like that. I just made this song to be cute and awesome. \n And it doesn't make her seem too evil.", "This is the Stage 3 theme. \n This one is so nostalgic... I'm sure those who are familiar with Touhou's older works will recognize it, but it sounds like a song I did a few years ago. \n I made it in the same way, so it's very nostalgic, but what good is it if it's only nostalgic to me? (Haha) \n This theme is a bit out of place. It has some of the 80s flavor in it.", "This is Kamishirasawa Keine's theme. \n It's both serious and mysterious. \n I really like the striking melodious feeling conveyed by the piano in the intro. \n To me, Japanese culture is sort of a natural progression in East Asia. \n So the soothing elements of Japanese music are never to be taken lightly.", "This is the Stage 4 theme. \n This song is an arrangement of the game's title screen theme. It's a nice tune with a very quick tempo. \n For the end, I put in a laughing sound, like that of a youkai. However, it's unnatural to hear it where it should not be creepy. \n Altogether, the rhythm is odd. I feel there's a hind to encroaching madness in it.", "This is Hakurei Reimu's theme. \n If you're wondering why this theme is nostalgic, it's an arrangement of a song from a few years ago. It's an arranged version of Reimu's Stage 4 boss theme from the fourth game, Lotus Land Story. The patterns in Stage 4 closely resembles those of Lotus Land Story, so I thought I'd do a similar song and give some people deja vu. \n The other theme for this game is \"An Old Memory Called Fantasy\".", "This is Kirisame Marisa's Theme. \n At this point, this song isn't all nostalgic or anything. It's an arrange of an old tune from the second game, Story of Eastern Wonderland. \n I was wondering if this theme still suited Marisa, and what shocked me is that it totally did. It's rare to see someone so unchanged. \n Marisa has 5 themes, but I think this one suits her best.", "This is the Stage 5 theme. \n Asian, Western, old, new-- This song isn't one or the other. The boss seems that way, too, but the stage itself is based in Japanese horror. \n Each song has a theme, and this one's based on the song \"Kagome, Kagome\". It's not an arrangement, just composed with a similar theme. \n I didn't want to get caged in on a theme for this one.", "This is Reisen U. Inaba's theme. \n When you think of a boss in the final stages of Touhou, this is what comes to mind. Guess some things never change. (Haha) \n After the wild intro, there's a mournful melody in the middle before the hook breaks through. \n Ah, all the characters look like they're having so much fun.", "This is the Stage 6 theme. \n The 20th century voyagers-- \n The Noah's Ark of the 20th century flew into space, carrying with it hopes and fears. \n However, it seems that just its hopes were left behind on the moon. \n Here in the \"future\", in the 21st century, only fears and a handful of illusions seem to be all that remain.", "This is Yagokoro Eirin's theme. \n Impossible courage, ferocity, and vigor-- \n This theme combines all of those, making for a ridiculously foolish and energetic song. \n All the energy and foolishness culminates in the final boss (really?), so the act itself of putting this song in a shmup is lunacy. \n I didn't want to get caged in on a theme for this one.", "This is Houraisan Kaguya's theme. \n Boy, she really is MAD, huh? (Haha) This song brings out a feeling of losing one's cool. \n I don't express emotions through songs, I make songs with emotions. And really, the game makes the songs. \n They're not very cool and modern, are they? (Haha) \n I'll admit I'm no pro.", "This is the Last Spell theme. \n All it inspires is a frantic feeling. It's seriously fast. \n It's the constant repetition of a short phrase that makes it so fast. \n That doesn't sound like my kind of morning. (Haha) \n Of course, it is fast, but it also has a mysterious kind of nostalgia.", "This is the Extra Stage theme. \n It's kind of relaxed for one, huh? \n It feels like a test of courage that wouldn't scare anybody. (No, it doesn't). \n I'm actually a little unsure about it, but it's extended. I collected E, X, T, E, N and D and extended it.", "This is Fujiwara no Mokou's theme. \n I tried to bring out as much intimidation, power and coolness I could that some shadiness came out. But even if the song isn't shady, the character certainly is. \n I always like kicking it old school for the Extra Boss song. This time around I really kicked it.", "This is the ending theme. \n It's still the same. All laid back. \n The ending song is never all that upbeat. And this one is no exception.", "This is the credits theme. \n I added a little nostalgia to this one. \"Maple\", such an old memory. This theme is loaded with old memories. But there's far too few staff.", "This is the Last Word theme. \n I wanted it to invoke feelings that deviate from the frame of the story. \n I'm not trying for coolness. \n I'm not trying for cuteness. \n I'm not even trying for creepiness. \n But it would be nice if it doesn't put you in a bad mood after listening to it for so long.",

The key feeling of this song is \"This is what the Touhou world is like\".", "Based on Reimu's theme from Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream. I really liked the old FM synth music, too.", "Reimu's night-time theme. As the title says, it's an arranged version of \"Maiden's Capriccio\". It's used in the shrine, so I've arranged in the fake Japanese taste. Maybe. I'd already finished with this song before summer came, so when I listened to the \"Maiden's Capriccio\" from Imperishable Night, I wondered if maybe I messed up the parts I changed. Anyway, if I made it the same, my work would be just a poor copy, so I think it's okay this way.", "Based on Marisa's theme from Story of Eastern Wonderland. The atmosphere finally became calm. In \"Imperishable Night\", it will upgrade to \"Master Spark\" (the future tense).", "Marisa's theme in the night. I also call it ... \"The song where I eventually lost the original idea through continual remaking: Part 1\". I meant to have this played by people, but I never thought about that while writing it, so parts of it ended up being pretty hard to play. Well, that meant it was a pain for me to edit later, too. Anyway, it's unsightly to write about production difficulties. But I did it anyway.", "From the stage 5 theme in Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. It looks like the common theme is \"Maid = rock music\". My initial image was a North European metal rock piece, but it's just not hard enough.", "Sakuya's night theme. It feels like all the hard edges of the original were taken out; maybe it's too soft. It also has too many fabricated parts. I also wanted to play the guitar by myself if I could, but I ended up not being able to. I'd like to do another secret arrangement if I can.", "Based on the stage 3 theme from Perfect Cherry Blossom. The forest where Alice lives is dark both day and night. Alice has many kinds of dolls, so I wanted the song's atmosphere to change a lot, but it stayed pretty constant.", "Alice's night-time stage theme. This song has a five-beat rhythm and weird sounds stuck into it, so it ought to fit the character's performance pretty well. But because I tried to throw in so many unusual elements, eventually I noticed the parts that made the original song great were gone. Hmm. This has nothing to do with the music, but I don't think the 2P color is quite right.", "Based on Patchouli's theme from Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. The original song is pretty dark, but Pache looks pretty energetic in IaMP. (She even goes outside.)", "Patchouli's night-time stage theme. This is for the night-time stage, but it's actually brighter than the daytime stage because of all the lights, so I made it louder. As a result, it turned into the Exciting, Ever-Moving Great Library. The latter half retains elements of the original, though even I cannot recognize very much.", "Theme of Youmu from Perfect Cherry Blossom.

There're plenty of fairy tales for children like Momotarou, Issunboushi, Kintarou, etc. I wanted to make a song that would fit well with that sort of fun-loving, happy oni. That sort of fearlessness is irresistable. Anyway, there's a story that got left out of the ones I mentioned above; I wonder which it is? While we consider this, why don't we go drinking with an oni tonight, too?", "The music played at the ending scene. I can't help being a little sad after all the festivals end. During the summer and winter Comiket festivals I'm totally exhausted, and before I know it all three days have passed... (Time for the festival afterwards.)", "The music for the credits. I had a definite image for the opening (nevermind the results), so I basically did whatever I want with this song. There aren't many limits on the nature of the credits music. It's really great when the music matches with the words on the screen, but if it doesn't work because somebody forgot something it really sucks, it makes me want to cry. By the way, I played the melodion part myself.", "Scenario music. It sounds like music you'd hear playing where a bad person is. But it's so short ...", "Music for a scenario. It's not for use during dialogue, so it doesn't last very long. It's almost like sound effects.", "Music for a scenario. The title originally meant to go around training in different places, but it seems everyone's just going around making a ruckus ...", "Music for a scenario. It sounds like they don't know what to do.", "Music for a scenario. It sounds like a song that plays when you visit a suspicious person. Well, she has the most common sense in Touhou.", "Music for a scenario. Eastern wind brings cool in summer. The girls face this incident making a riot. The music expresses their anxiety whether they can solve the incident. Even so, it doesn't sound like Touhou.", "This was originally based on the opening theme, but it wasn't very interesting, so I changed a lot of things until it became something totally unrecognizable. I love the funny \"chupa-chupa\" sound.", "I thought it wouldn't be used, but it got slipped in some time, so I was surprised. All the music for conversation was composed before I really understood the details of scenario, so several pieces may not fit the scenes well ... that's my excuse.", "I wanted to make something mysterious. I wonder if it feels that way to you. It's pretty boring if you listen to this by itself, but I guess that's good for dialogue music. I think it suits that purpose well.", "This was also put in unexpectedly, so I changed some melodies and arrangements. I wanted to make the second half really serious-sounding. But it's long enough that a lot of people don't hear the second half.", "I think it ended up relatively BGM-like. I composed it with a feeling that the Touhou-like piano was faster like this. I cannot say \"Touhou-like\" except the part of the piano. This is the music that I wanted to compose the first part more carefully.", "The conversation theme of fighting game should be excited but calmer than that of the coming battle part... I thought like that at first, though I thoroughly ignored. It has no processes and is very simple. By the way, the code name was \"Iwao\".", "I needed something for the conversation, so I composed earlier. The strange melody is what I added later, but it may be a somewhat waste material. Even so, I prefer the melody like that.", "Theme for conversation that has a fake Japanese taste. I hope it excites you. It has only main-like part so as to understand easily. It seems to be used for the conversation of the final stage, but it's too bad it doesn't really connect well to the last boss music.",

  "The title screen theme. \n It's the same old tune, yep. \n This is probably one of the silliest parts of the game itself, but it's remained constant over time. \n Maybe it's not silly enough. But this is Gensokyo.", "Hakurei Reimu's theme. \n I tried to write this one so you would feel spring itself through the piece. Not purely Japanese, but more like Touhou style. \n I thought it'd be good to not have it wear down on people during long battles, so I controlled its intensity, but compared to other, more intense pieces, it seems pretty sedate. Like Reimu?", "Kirisame Marisa's theme. \n The way I first composed this one made Marisa sound like a bad guy, so I added on a bit of playful antiquity to it. \n In doing so, that antiquity gave it a hind of Middle Eastern flair, which could be a problem. However, given th nature of this game, I'd like to believe this properly reflects the endless stream of action and suspense that happens.", "Izayoi Sakuya's theme. \n Since all of Sakuya's pieces from Embodiment of Scarlet Devil were all very hard and driving, I tried to make this one more human, or more fitting for a first stage. \n I can't explain why I don't think this melody fits, but how about you? \n What's weird to me is that if you think it's going to be an Asian piece, it sounds like it, but treat it as Western and it sounds like that too. If you think it's childlike, it's childlike, and if you think it's more mature, it sounds that way. Am I the only one who thinks so?", "Konpaku Youmu's theme. \n It's not the Perfect Cherry Blossom version, but the arranged vesion recorded in Ghostly Field Club. It draws out the coldness of the land of the dead. \n I used the boss themes for other characters, but here, I thought this one fit Youmu well, so I used it. Rather, I liked this one.", "Reisen Udongein Inaba's theme. \n I made a few tweaks to the original to make it a little more nostalgic. I had my reasons for the original, but for this game, it may have been a little too much. Almost like \"why's it so serious?\" Well, Imperishable Night's pieces were all just a little too much. \n Because it was about night and time... \n Well, maybe that doesn't make any sense. Could you say this one's about flowers and idiots... (oops)", "Cirno's theme. \n The old stupid^H^H^H^H^H^H cute song has become cool. It's weird how that worked, and it makes you wonder. \n Still, the melody itself seems pretty dumb. I wrote this in an Asian style, light and intense, not worrying about whether it fits the image of a little girl. Instead of Asian, it feels more Touhou, and I seem to have developed a special pattern without realizing it.", "The three Prismriver Sisters' theme. \n I rearranged this piece to exude a lighter atmosphere than the original. Some time later, I want to make a piece that showcases the sisters performing solo. \n Lunasa on violin, Merlin on trumpet, piano and accordion for Lyrica mmakes sense in this piece, but if you think about it, who's playing the drums and keeping beat?", "The bird, er, rather, Mystia Lorelei's theme. \n It's now three strong 30% increase. \n It sounds up-tempo enough to drive someone insane, but that's its purpose. Mystia is enjoying the flowers herself. \n Mystia's song is said to bewilder people, but if you listen to this, it sounds like a pretty harsh song. Of course it'll drive people nuts. A punk youkai.", "Inaba Tewi's theme. \n I designed this to be a little playful, sentimental, and Japanese. \n How is it? It came out fairly easygoing and cute, and I think it fits Phantasmagoria of Flower View to a T. \n Actually, the notes and scales used aren't Japanese. If you were to ask me \"where's the Japan in it?\", I really couldn't tell you. But doesn't it seem Japanese?", "Shameimaru Aya's theme. \n This is the short version of the theme to Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red. The original peice was a long six minutes, but such long battles in this game cannot happen, so I took the main section and looped it. \n I imagined a wind god girl looking good playing the trumpet when I made this. \n A world where feelings fly on the winds. This is the image I had in mind for Phantasmagoria of Flower View.", "Medicine Melancholy's theme. \n Phantasmagoria of Flower View's most unique composition. I wrote it to be a little Western and fairly dark in image. \n This boss-like and strangely uplifting piece hints at older arcade games. \n The sound of bells at the beginning of the song is a strangely unsettling sound. This is poison.", "Kazami Yuuka's theme. \n I thought to create a piece bright and fluid, with the elegance of a flower. It didn't come out that way. \n The main melody here is done on piano, and particularly as I was writing it, it brought back fond memories. \n I thought it'd be better to make the piano part longer, but piano doesn't seem to fit the game all that well, so it's shorter.", "Onozuka Komachi's theme. \n To sweep away everything, and see what remains is the destiny of the mid-boss. This one reflects that fate, as well as the feeling of sweeping away. \n Touhou has done this sweeping idea in the past, but I feel like this is the first time I've put so much exhilaration and pathos into a piece. \n On the higan retour, that there would be no regrets as this piece...", "Shiki Eiki Yamaxanadu's theme. \n Obviously, a theme for a last boss. A melodious last boss theme is a Touhou trademark. This time, Japan + rebirth + country of cherry blossoms are the images I mixed together. \n This song full of strength and ephemerality is a song for the as-yet unseen most beautiful land of cherry blossoms. \n As silly as the whole game may be, this piece alone evokes strong feelings.", "The conversation theme. \n Though it's an edit of the title theme, it adds a little to the nervousness before a match. Maybe it makes it all that much more illusionary. \n If there was a problem, it's that there is no nervousness to speak of before a match. Something just seems wrong, from the beginning.", "The second conversation theme. \n As it's the end of the game, I prepared an element of impatience. \n Exceptionally short, it's not much to speak of. Well, at least it's a Touhou-sounding piece.", "The ending theme. \n I don't know... Touhou ending themes, in their entirety, always sound like bad endings. \n Could it be that clearing shooting games itself gives humanity a bad ending? (nah, no way)", "The staff roll theme. \n I thought about making a lighter staff roll than normal, but I regret making it both light and almost empty. Like I should have made one of those two stand out. \n Well, I hope it has a sense of closure. But, it also feels like a beginning to me. It's not bad, right?",

No, there's nothing wrong with your monitor or speakers, so relax.", "Photo theme 1. \n For this game, instead of the usual boss battle music, I wanted it to be more casual, so I wrote this. \n It has a very relaxed feel, because Aya is enjoying herself - as if she were teasing her target.", "Photo theme 2. \n It's easygoing enough to seem scary and cute. \n Though kidnapping and eating people is a youkai thing to do, this cheerfulness that must have come from somewhere is also part of the fabled tengu image. \n I think this piece mixes that scariness, cuteness, cheerfulness, and carelessness together.", "Photo theme 3. Written for the middle levels. \n While it feels like both the boss and Aya are having fun, it is hard to convey the feeling of the boss being coerced. \n This tune is aware of that, so while being light and bright, it was written to also bring out the strength of the boss. Especially the piano.", "Photo theme 4. Written for the latter half of the game. \n I feel, deep inside, that this hinks at retro Japan. \n Snow, falling in the capital. a deserted night road. \n But this retro is my idea of retro... \n Listening to this might make you reminisce.", "Photo theme 5. \n This is Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red's main theme, so I couldn't leave it out. \n Though this edit is rarely used :-)",

  //Eastern and Little Nature Deity
  "This is the theme of the sunlight fairy, Sunny Milk. I could easily use this song as it is in a game. If I were to make a game where they all appeared at once, this song would be the most suitable. \n It is indeed a song that feels like the theme of a boss in the first half of my games, casual and not too serious. The hook that feels like it's flowing backwards with its sparkling beeping sounds feels very much like Sunny. I like how the super-speedy bass and the unexpectedly Eastern-style melody match each other. However, everyone else seems to forcefully make it a point that it really wouldn't work in a game... \n By the way, Sunny's ability to refract light is also able to do so at negative refractive indexes. While no common substance is able to do this, it is said to be optimal for hiding oneself. \n Even rutile never stood a chance against Sunny's power.", "This is the theme of the moonlight fairy, Luna Child. \n Just the slightest bit serious. If I had to say, it would be used for a stage theme in a game. Among the main characters in this book, I would say that Luna had most of the better lines, but as a result of this, it's easy for the others to make fun of her. In other words, she has a very general personality that is easiest to understand. Those who are night-owls themselves will relate to her. \n In this song, I tried to combine the feel of the stories in this book, too. I was trying to create something that has a strange rhythm if you listen very, very closely. \n And then the title. I believe it to express the straightforwardness of fairies and their mindset. Hunams can't sleep although it's nighttime. Fairies sleep because it's nighttime. Youkai don't sleep because it's nighttime. \n And she can't sleep because it's nighttime, even if she's sleepy. The moonlight is too bright for her.", "This is the theme of the starlight fairy, Star Sapphire. It's sort of carefree and peppy. If I had to say, it would be an ending theme, but I couldn't use it like that. \n I made this song while envisioning someone enjoying a stroll at night while dancing with their hands underneath a starry sky. \n It's good to make things enjoyable, but at some points in the song it feels a little lonely. I guess it feels as if I made the song with the image of just the fairies with no one else around, but fairies wouldn't see something like that as lonely. Fairies always move on their own. The Three Fairies are simply an exception to this rule. That's how the song feels (Maybe not that far). \n Star usually takes an observatory standpoint when Sunny and Luna bicker, sometimes she will feign ignorance and say something that will completely change the mood. \n There are many things that are represented by stars: planets, comets, meteors and other kinds of heavenly bodies.",
  //Mountain of Faith
  "This is the title theme. \n The same song as ever... \n I tried to make it really majestic, as befitting for a Japanese-style God. \n It's a pretty queer and unusual rhythm, but it all comes through if you keep listening to it. \n Especially, say, while you're debugging the game.", "This is the first stage theme. \n It's been many days since I last used this kind of mood. \n Considering the melodious pard where the tempo suddenly drops, and the tune which doesn't really cause any tension... I think this is the song most befitting of a stage 1 of all the stages 1 and 2 songs in Touhou games up until now. What do you think?", "This is Aki Minoriko's theme. \n It has a pretty good tempo compared to the rest. I tried making it with the image of a harvest festival and an inexperienced and thoughtless god. \n The only game that can do with this kind of tension-less piece is Touhou. Normally, fighting a boss with this kind of music would be difficult. \n It's a short loop, but the boss fight itself is short anyway.", "This is the second stage theme. \n In contrast with the first stage, this is a gloomy piece. \n It combines both western and oriental styles; I think it has a nice feeling to it. \n The boss is a gothic lolita, so the music turned out his way. \n The transition from the mysterious intro to the chorus where your field of vision expands has a pretty good feeling to it.", "This is Kagiyama Hina's theme. \n Since she's a gothic lolita, I thought I should make it a more painful kind of feeling, but when I thought of my own preferences, and the matter of the entire game, this kind of feeling just settled in. \n Well, she's just a stage 2 boss. It's better to make her look a bit stupid.", "This is the third stage theme. \n It's the first tune you hear after infiltrating Youkai Mountain. It's bursting with the heavy verses of Gensokyo. I prepared the best melodious tune I could for the beautiful valley the youkai reside in. \n I hope I have managed to convey a rather liberal feeling, in contrast to the darker stage two theme.", "This is Kawashiro Nitori's theme. \n You will hear this song quite a bit, so I've put forth my best effort so that you won't get tired of it. For that purpose, I've used some strange phrases and rhythms, but I wonder if it was any good. My hypothesis is that you'll be listening to this one a lot. Since my first impressions of the song, as I continued to listen to it, it seems to have gradually changed on me. \n As the concluding piece, it should end up having a rather sorrowful sound to it, I guess?", "This is the fourth stage theme. \n When you think of waterfalls, there are two images: the powerful, vast waterfall and the meek, trickling one. \n But this time, I opted for the image of the former. Touhou has always, always had a dark feel to it, so I tried to express a somewhat refreshing feel. Why is that? \n An autumn waterfall. I think the thing waterfalls convey the most is autumn.", "This is Shameimaru Aya's theme. \n I made the same Aya's theme, Wind God Girl, witht he image of Aya the newspaper reporter, but this time I emphasised the image of the youkai \"Tengu\" from ancient Japan. \n If I somehow gave it an old, nostalgic feeling, you too would become one of the youkai. \n Ahh, it feels so nostalgic.", "This is the fifth stage theme. \n This time, the Japanese element is deep throughout. \n Especially as it gets more Japanese the more you progress through the latter half. \n Comparing this tune to the other, the Japanese element is relatively small, but the very dark, nostalgic melody and rapid chorus feel very latter half. \n If you listen to it combined with the gameplay, it feels even more latter half (well, it is the latter half). \n Even so, the Moriya Shrine seems even more extravagant than the Hakurei Shrine...", "This is Kochiya Sanae's theme. \n It feels like the metal section suddenly got bigger here; I thought I'd give this a heavy feeling, but I got careless and overdid it, which is a bad habit of mine. Tee hee. \n Whether it's the melody or something else, it's the heaviest in this game. From this point on, it suddenly becomes bright, and at the end it kind of lost its touch... \n The stronger they are, the less the feeling of tension: this is the promise in Gensokyo.", "This is the sixth stage theme. \n Since the stage is short, the tune is also short. The final stage has a drawn out Last Boss battle, so if I didn't make the path leading to it shorter, it would lose its potency, which is why it's short. I'm not omitting the vital steps. \n I tried expressing the feeling \"hey, something's about to start\" in this tune. \n Of course something's going to start, since it is the final stage after all.", "This is Yasaka Kanako's theme. \n This is a strange god who makes all human and youkai her friends with an overwhelming power. \n I composed a part which makes you feel awe towards a god, and a part which makes you feel the gravity of history. \n Anyhow, it's a playful tune which possesses ample reckless abandon. There's a huge difference compared to Sanae in the melody, but maybe this is the difference between gods and humans.", "This is the extra stage theme. \n I thought of writing the most cheerful piece for this game. \n Not especially tasty yakisoba, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and heavily seasoned gesoyaki. And unusually expensive. \n Served as a junk food snack platter, with cans of beer, all the while gazing at the grounds. \n I love that kind of festival day at the shrine. That's one of the ways of enjoy beer.", "This is Moriya Suwako's theme. \n It's a cheerful piece with a rapid feeling. Moreover, I tried to add a Japanese and childish feeling to the melody. It fits Suwako perfectly. \n Such a lively tune is on the contrary, actually a piano piece from hell. \n Again, this song has an abundance of chaos, even moreso than Kanako. \n You'd definitely think she was playing around with the shrine maiden, what with the particularly high speed piano.", "This is the ending theme. \n This time, there are many triple beats that permeate your whole body. I feel that things like triple beat match the Japanese-style game nicely. \n It asserts itself modestly without being too dark or too light. \n Made this way, it becomes an atmospheric piece, thus it's suitable for any scene.", "This is the Staff Cridits theme. \n Pray to the gods for rain, and rain will fall. It doesn't have any relevance to the actual story, but the simplest thing to understandas a god's blessing is rain, so... \n The wind god doesn't just make the wind blow like a tengu can; there's also a connection to the meaning of harvest gods. If you think of farming, you think rain. That's why it's rain.", "This is the Game Over theme. \n It's too lonely when the Game Over screen is silent, so I put this in. \n Oh, how mysterious, it's even more lonely, now. \n But why?",

  "I thought of making it an arrange of \"Sunny's Rutile Flection\" with the style of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, but when I finished, it ended up being a completely different piece. While the fierce battles go on, you can see the figure of a fairy collecting bugs or something by the side of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. If that piece from the days of yore ended up in a fairy's hands...", "I made this second piece with the image of Perfect Cherry Blossom in mind. Perfect Cherry Blossom had that general feel of time going on calmly. It feels traditionally Japanese, snowy, and somewhat wistful... I think it closes up with a nice feeling. For the rhythm, I mixed some drunken and fairy-like feelings.", "I made this third piece with the image of Imperishable Night in mind. And Imperishable Night is all about aliens. Just as my favourite outlook of space is, I made this piece vast, dark, and exciting. But it might be that it turned out too cool to be a Three Fairies piece, to tell you the truth.",
  //Silent Sinner in Blue
  "If space travel were so easy as to say \"Tonight, I think I'll go to the moon\"... was what I thought of when I composed this. \n Travelling to the moon in a wooden rocket made from the ancient upholstery attached to the fireplace with the whole contraption shaking all the while. \n On a different note, the discontinued line for the stove train in Aomori is apparently in danger of being dismantled. \n I want to ride it just once before it passes into fantasy.", "This is a song I made for the Watatsuki sisters, who didn't appear much in the first volume but should engage in combat with our carefree invaders before long. \n The Watatsuki sisters are equally carefree. \n However, when it comes to battle, they are stronger. \n I think it's a song with a sense of nervousness yet plenty of room for composure.", "I think of Silent Sinner in Blue as a wild, drunken manga for drunken readers. \n In order for this song to be that drunken, I remade a song I originally created while under the influence of drunken vigor using FM synthesis. \n I worry that I see drunkenness as pointlessly cool.",

Turning it around, you might say she's an oasis within Heaven. \n Not that this has anything to do with the song, really.", "The Last Spell theme. \n I made \"Catastrophe in Bhavaagra\" to sound space-like in my own way. \n Pipe organs are very space-like, aren't they?", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "",

  "This is the title theme. \n Well, it's the same feeling as always. \n One thing that's very cave-like about caves is the sounds that echo around in them, so I did my best to make it cave-like. \n Caves are great.", "This is the first stage theme. \n Since it's in a cave, I made it darker than my usual stage 1 themes. \n It's cute, with a little uneasiness to it... well, the good rhythm hides the uneasiness and make a trap out of it. \n I think I'd like to try a horror game with a sense of speed to it, too.", "This is Kurodani Yamame's theme. \n I thought I'd try making it cool for a stage one song. \n It's a very simple song with that particular game music feel to it. \n I think it's best if a simple melody helps bring the game action to a climax.", "This is the second stage theme. \n We're going down deeper and deeper. \n It's not too bold and very ambient, so it's the travelling song of travelling songs. \n Somehow it feels kind of Japanese, but that wasn't on purpose, hence the \"somehow\". By the way, this has nothing to do with anything, but caves are great.", "This is Mizuhashi Parsee's theme. \n She's a youkai with a wounded heart. \n So, I thought I'd like to make her a melodious song, and this is how it ended up. \n You wouldn't think it's a song for a shooting game, but when I tried to think of something good for a shooting game, it settled down into something like this.", "This is the third stage theme. \n It has that peaceful brawl feeling to a certain Edo street. \n It's best to be light and cheerful, after all, isn't it? \n This song also has a very nostalgic feel to it. \n I'd love to swagger down the city streets with as much excitement as this song has sometime.", "This is Hoshiguma Yuugi's theme. \n I was aiming for a strong, very playful image. \n In fact, Yuugi is teaching herself how to fight without spilling a drop of the sake from her cup. She must be bored. \n Somehow I think the oni of hell have more fun than humans.", "This is the fourth stage theme. \n I tried not to make it too one-sidedly Japanese. \n The Palace of the Earth Spirits is surprisingly Western. The people who live there are probably fancy, too. \n But, it's a cat house. I want to be tamed by the cat.", "This is Komeiji Satori's theme. \n She's the master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits. She's a little fancy and loves animals. \n Actually, she should be the highest ranked enemy in Subterranean Animism, but it looks like fighting isn't her specialty. \n I tried to make the song dramatic and otherworldly, too.", "This is the fifth stage theme. \n Since people stopped being condemned to the hellfires, the oni don't visit anymore either, so this place has become the playground to spirits and animals. \n Actually, I'm thrilled whenever I see something like a building people have abandoned. \n The grounds of former hell must be enveloped in the sort of loneliness that surrounds ruins... is what I thought of as I made this.", "This is Orin's theme. \n This is the theme for a cherry, yet bizarre cat. \n Since stages 4 and 5 were very heave, I tried to clear it up in a flash. \n The cart Orin is pushing is a wheelbarrow. What's it carrying, you say? \n Best not to ask such questions, I think.", "This is the last stage's theme. \n I tried to make it feel like an end-of-game song. \n Flying through lava is standard fare for shooting games. \n I guess if there's anything in particular I'm trying to say, it's that it's not unusual for shrine maidens to fly above lava like this.

The song title has no relation to a certain shooting game.", "This is Komeiji Koishi's theme. \n I tried to make it eerie and have the aura of a broken girl. \n I think the eeriness is fitting for an extra boss. \n Actually, I think a garden with roses strewn all about where thorns can prick you is really fitting for a battle, but for some reason it's the shrine this time.", "This is the ending theme. \n The theme here is staying up all night drinking and then making your lonely way homw. \n The vengeful spirits head back into the depths of the earth, saying to themselves, \"Aw, the festival's over\", and \"I guess we'd better be getting back now\". \n Those vengeful spirits are such old fogeys.", "This is the staff roll theme. \n I made it the same as always.

  "This is the theme I imagined would continue the specially-drawn comic, the Great Fairy Wars. I imagine that Great Fairy Wars will be the opening story to a normal shooting game. This theme has a so-called feel of the middle of a shooting game. After what's in the comic, nobody knows whether the fairies will really be having a great war or just having a party in the midst of the cherry blossoms. I think this theme carries the atmosphere of both. Though the start of this theme has the feel of the start of a journey, it also gives an image of fairies stopping by here and there on their journey that they forget their destination, so what do you think?", "", "", "",

Flash of insight!", "This is the stage 4 theme. \n Aren't journeys great? I feel the most excited when I'm riding on a vessel. \n Even if it's the ship of the infamous ghost captain who sinks lots of other ships. \n I mixed anticipation and anxiety together as much as I could when making this song, trying to give it a sense of excitement.", "This is Murasa Minamitsu's theme. \n Since she sinks lots of ships, she's a well-known ghost captain. \n I tried to give it a \"captain\" atmosphere, so it's a little too cool. \n Everyone calls her Murasa, but murasa is the name of a youkai, so they're not really calling her by name - surprise!", "This is the stage 5 theme. \n This is a song with irregular rhythms, but it's upbeat. Pretty Makai-ish. \n It gets pretty intense when you're listening to it with the song effects from gameplay, so I hope you'll listen closely while playing. \n The name comes from the song having both a rural and an urban feel.", "This is Toramaru Shou's theme. \n I gave this song a quiet, but strong feel. The second half is awfully boss-ish. \n It's a feeling of dignity rather than terror. \n Still, those lasers coming one after the other are pretty scary. \n They're old-man killers so you need really good reflexes to dodge.", "This is the stage 6 theme. \n A song with too much tension. \n The stage is short and not too hard, so I had to add to the tension. \n The heartbeats make you want to hurry, don't they?", "This is Hijiri Byakuren's theme. \n From the quiet heartbeat, suddenly it feels like the world is opening up. \n This is the theme of a last boss who is hard to tire out, probably. \n It's overall fairly melodiously Japanese, and I tried to make the melody of the main part like one of those songs where everyone's singing. Human, bare your feeling and GO!", "This is the extra stage theme. \n Aren't UFOs cute? \n The extra is much different than the main stages, and this song is a cute send-off. \n I went for a pop feel for this song. \n UFOs are kind of pop-ish, after all.", "This is Houjuu Nue's theme. \n A vigorously youkai youkai song. \n It's a song with an old-fashioned, Japanese sense of terror and sorrow floating about. \n Isn't it really fitting for an EX boss? \n The mostly one-shot recording full of ad-libbing is also pretty EX-ish.", "This is the ending theme. \n Usually the ending is for a Shinto shrine, but this time it's for a Buddhist temple. \n Temples have a much darker image than shrines. \n Well, calling it \"dark\" is kind of rude. I meant \"boring\" (just kidding)", "This is the staff roll theme. \n It ended up being an arrangement of Emotional Skyscraper. \n This song has the feel of a quiet trip home after a journey. \n Oh, look up there~, there's a UFO in the night sky.",

The youkai who lost their dignity living happily in the shadow of Gensokyo seems just like a youkai space colony. \n Let's do the coverage on such youkai with gusto and put them up on center stage. \n Plenty of room yet, plenty of room.", "The third event coverage theme. \n Okay, now we're into the advanced levels. From here on, shot counts in the hundreds is common, right? \n I wrote this with the image of you facing your tough news coverage opponent in mind. \n The melody is a bit manly handsome, but I'm pretty confident that I made the sounds and rhythm produce a slightly cute feel. \n Wow, the advanced levels are tough!", "The fourth event coverage theme. \n It is said that when one rings Bell of Avici, it will bring one happiness in this life, but will drop one into the Avici, the worst level of Hell, where suffering continues unabated, in the afterlife. \n This was likely the song people would be stuck hearing for the longest time, so I decided to restrain the liveliness, making it harder to get tired of it. \n This truly is a non-stop hell.

Since this time, the theme concerns both the Perfect Cherry Blossom world and the Undefined Fantastic Object world, the netherworld had to be there. \n It sounds melodious, but I made it rhythmical so that I won't forget that it's a first stage song.", "Saigyouji Yuyuko's theme. \n Not really an easy piece to classify. \n Since I had to bring out the fact that she's only a first strage boss, I stopped myself from arranging a previous song of hers. \n In this game she just acts as a \"nameless npc willager\" who helps the protagonists on their way.", "The second stage theme. \n Normally a temple is nice and quiet in the morning. \n But in a temple that youkai live in, it's noisier from night to daybreak. \n Youkai that live in the temple... Doesn't that bring up all sorts of images? \n Using that image, I made it my own sort of Japanese song.", "Kasodani Kyouko's theme. \n Do people still shout \"Yahoo\" when they go to the mountains? \n Or do you feel embarrassed all of a sudden and can't find the courage to shout? \n Well of course the yamabiko get bored, it's understandable for them to go in to Buddhism from the boredom. \n By the way, if you try to relieve stress by shouting \"Idiot!\" out toward the open sea, you'll startle the fishermen.", "The third stage theme. \n Cemeteries that appear in games - unless it's a horror game - tends to make you imagine of a comical one. So there's no meaning in making the music too dark and heavy too. \n So I brushed it up with a comical feel as much as I can. \n I can't resist this nostalgic feeling (Personally too)", "Miyako Yoshika's theme. \n Although she is a Jiang Shi, she was based on a zombie, so her theme's introduction is a little exotic. But then as I was writing it I noticed that the introduction has something of a Egyptian feel, sort of like a pyramid or something. \n But that would be a mummy, not a zombie...", "The fourth stage theme. \n I made it a flowing song to completely switch away from the first half of the game. \n It feels nice to rush through a narrow space at high speed. \n This is okay in caves, but don't run in halls at school or in the work office. \n Caves are nice. (You shouldn't run in a limestone cavern, either.)", "Kaku Seiga's theme. \n She's a wicked hermit. Kind of like a magician that does a large assortment of tricks. \n So, I aimed for a suspicious song where you never know what's going to fly out at you next. \n Being able to pass througe walls would be useful for running away, but it's not useful for fighting, is it? It would be a critical hit to a nurikabe, though.", "The fifth stage theme. \n Since we just came barreling through a narrow cave, I decided to write a nice, expansive song to contrast it. \n It's so stimulating to find such enormous spaces underground, isn't it? \n I wanted to compose something that would make you feel that kind of excitement", "Mononobe no Futo's theme. \n Since it's Mononobe-san, the title is pronounced \"Oomiwa Shinwaden\". \n I get the feeling that there aren't many games that are themed around the time between the Tumulus periods and Asuka periods. Maybe people just can't picture an image of them? \n This song was written with only the sound of Asuka in mind.

Many thanks~", "The extra stage theme. \n You never know what kind of retro youkai might pop onto the road with this song. \n Youkai always seem to have such fun no matter the circumstances. \n That's probably because they're enlightened by knowing exactly what their purpose in life is. \n In that case, there's one way to be sure to enjoy life. Accept whetever you've got now.", "Futatsuiwa Mamizou's theme. \n It's full of that old taniki feeling. \n Both foxes and tanuki are seen as tricksters, but of the two, taniki seem more laid-back, right?

Different from the other one, I made this with the image of a not serious, but clearly unformidable foe. Even if they're a boss, if they aren't that strong, the difference is like night and day (lol). The original song was very short, so I rearranged it, adding a bit more of a melodious feel to it. Where the \"Staking Your Life\" in the title comes from is like how kids will just throw out \"I bet my life on it.\" or \"A promise until I die\". Kids or adults wouldn't stake their lives on the things they say.", "This was originally the hermit's theme, fast, furious and kind of Chinese, but surprisingly this kind of song fits the Three Fairies to a T so I included it.

  "The title screen theme.  \n This theme turned out a bit spacey and Japanese. \n For this game, the excitement factor could be described as \"unconventional\".", "The first stage theme. \n This song is a bit long for the first stage. \n The game is pretty long as a whole, so I designed it to match. \n Itt feels like they are making up their mind to leave their beautiful green earth for a while.", "Seiran's theme. \n  I brought out the feelling oof having fun with a really light-hearted battle. \n Rabbits don't seem to have it in their nature to be serious. \n You can't see it, but she does have a tail.", "The second stage theme. \n Making us feel uneasy with the changing situation, this song became one \n that wouldn't feel out-of-place in the latter half of the game. \n It seems like only a selected few can see the pulse given off by the moon.", "Ringo's theme. \n Unlike Seiran, she's a rabbit who works in the background rather than a soldier. \n On top of being a powerful opponent, this song depicts her doubts as to whether or not fighting is really the right thing to do \n All those dango were enjoyed by the TV staff afterward, of course.", "The third stage theme. \n It looks like space, but it's actually the mental world. So it is an 'all just a dream' twist, in a sense. \n The fairies and phantoms wandering around are the dreams of said creatures in reality. \n It's mischievous of them to spread barrages of danmaku even in dreams.", "Doremy Sweet's theme. \n It gives off a strong sense of foreboding. \n I wrote this with thoughts of \"I want you to be wary from here on out\", \n \"I want you to have a nightmare\", and so on. \n Even if you have a nightmare, it'll be fine if you pray to change it. Pray to Doremy.", "The fourth stage theme. \n It's the Lunar Capital. For a particular reason, however, it's now a ghost town. \n It's a song with a calm atmosphere, but on the contrary, it evokes an image of madness. \n It's music more befitting the endgame of an RPG than a shooting game Well, it is the endgame.", "Kishin Sagume's theme. \n A theme song for a mysterious person who's not quite an enemy or an ally, a god or an oni. \n Hence, I composed it with a rather mysterious mood. \n Actually, she's also kind of an Amanojaku, isn't she? That would make her the second one.", "The fifth stage theme. \n Some minor variations to the mood make this a fast-paced, romantic tune. \n It's a stage where you can move forward (and rack up a huge score) at a good pace. \n Feels real nice \n I hope you feel a sense of flight, and the resolve to travel far.", "Clownpiece's theme. \n She's the most crazy-strong fairy seen yet. \n Although she's pretty ordinary in the head. Having made it gothic, Japanese, and spacey at the same time, this is a pretty odd song. The fear of clowns is pretty widespread these days. \n But this fairy clown isn't all that scary ... right?", "The sixth stage theme. \n It's the seaaa. It's summeeerr. \n This song is a subset of the final boss' theme. \n I want to go to the seaaa. I want to drink beer in a beach huuut.", "Junko's theme. \n I think this song says, \"now this is unmistakably the final boss!\" \n I didn't ty to make it too complicated, or to add cool parts, or just overthink it in general. \n I hope you can enjoy her danmaku simply and purely.", "The Exta Stage theme. \n First the eerie intro, then it flows into the simple and usual Touhou style. \n It really does have that Extra feel. \n Nonetheless, is Doremy your foe this time? \n Or is she your friend?", "Hecatia Lapizlazuli's theme. \n This is quite a demonic piece of music. \n I actually thought about making a metal song, but I'm not well-versed in that area \n and it felt like it wouldn't fit the setting, so I made it like this in the end. \n My thought proces wa Hell -> Shinigami -> Death -> Death Metal. Pretty poor idea.", "The ending theme. \m Well, it's the usual theme. \n Because I usually write songs that are always upbeat, \n I feel like novel game music and such must be a real challenge.", "The staff roll theme. \n It's an alternate version of the title screen ong. \n I gave it an even spacier mood than before.",

  "This is the title screen theme. \n A theme with a \"we're about to begin\" sort of feeling. \n It ended up having a Japanese, lighthearted, and somewhat serious feel to it.", "This is the Stage 1 theme. \n I tried to bring out an \"introductory\" feeling, along with the exhilaration of summer. \n It's a pretty light theme, even by Touhou standards. \n Did I manage to express a feeling of speed, I wonder? \n With all said and done, it goes well with a beer.", "This is Eternity Larva's theme. \n I went for a feeling of \"a fairy whth something mysterious hidden within her\". I think butterflies that appear in video games are definitely a symbol \n of mysteriousness. \n I mean, she's just a fairy, so her head's empty, but still.", "This is the Stage 2 theme. \n In contrast to Stage 1's unending cheer, I added a sort of melancholy to this one \n and brought out an autumnal fel. \n Tailoring the music to sound uniform across the whole, even as the seasons change, is kind of fun.", "This is Sakata Nemuno's theme. \n I think this theme turned out particularly video-gamey. \n Yikes, it's a yamanba. They show up often in folk tales, but in spite of that, \n they're a pretty hard creature to pin down. \n Using eerines and hot-blodded fervor as my base, I made a Touhou-style theme.", "This is the Stage 3 theme. \n The concept for this one is \"flying high in the night sky \n where only the cherry blossoms are shining in the moonlight\". \n Cherry blossoms always have a sense of fleetingness about them, and this time is no different.", "This is Komano Aunn's theme. \n A feeling of spring, bravery, and a somewhat-strong opponent, as well a that of a Yuru-chara. \n It's an all-over-the-place theme with all those things crammed into it. \n Her character concept is \"a single divine beast acting as a pair\", but sh doesn't have a split personality or anything. \n Also, you can't see it, but she's got herself a tail!", "This is the Stage 4 theme. \n \"Winter\" means \"blizzards\", that's for sure. \n You might not know this if you don't live in a snowy country, but blizzards are actually different from \n rainstorms. They happen when snow gets whipped up off the ground and blows back down on a horizontal slant. \n Wearing a straw hat in one is pointless.", "this is Yatadera Narumi's theme. \n I composed it with an image of someone with her feel planted firmly on the ground. \n The original Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is a very honorabl figure who provided salvationin the long period until Maitreya appears, \n but at some point or another, a countless number of eccentric Jizo statues spread throughout all of Japan. \n So I figure it'd be nice if there were a magic Jizo somewhere in there.", "This is the Stage 5 theme. \n A world that's creepier than anything in Touhou thus far. \n Although, when you consider the fact that all those doors are connected \n to people's backs, I guess you could call it convenient in a way. \n They seem like they'd be kind of lukewarm, those doors.", "This is Teireida Mai and Nishida Satono's theme. \n I incorporated a great deal of things into this song: eeriness, lightheartedness, \n strong hostility, innoccence, and on top of all that, a midboss-esque feeling. \n I put enough in for both characters, so it's an extravagant song in a number of ways. \n Created with an image of them dancing madly and eerily.", "This is the Stage 6 theme. \n Made with an image of a high-speed stage before the boss. \n I think it exudes a feeling of rushed along, regardless of the nature of the story going on.", "This is Matara Okina's theme. \n A very \"This is the climax!\" sort of song with a lot of strength to it. \n It's got a strong melody, even compared to the other songs in the game, so it might've been nice if I just went all-in and started singing lyrics to it. \n It's very likely that you'd start laughing too hard to even play the game, but that might actually be the best outcome.", "This is the Extra Stage theme. \n A mysterious world that we dive into once more, having mustered up our resolve. \n It's a song that combines both eeriness and gentleness. \n The song does a good job of conveying the stage's difficulty, so it's pretty depressing (lol)", "This is Matara Okina's (true) theme. \n Even though it's an Extra Stage, it wound up being part of the main story. \n Since it's your true battle with Okina, I swept away all the refreshing feeling of nature \n but still ade it a song with a strong melody befitting of the true final boss. \n Honestly, getting attacked from behind is just the worst!", "This is the ending theme. \n It kind of feels like a bad ending, but to tell the truth, \n all the endings this time are like bad endings.", "This is the staff roll theme. \n It's a different version of the winter stage theme made with an image of a refreshing conclusion. \n Speaking of which. Why is a \"winter blizzard\" song refreshing, you ask? \n That's because I made it with \"early morning\" in mind. \"During winter, the best time of day is early morning\", as they say.",

  "this is the Title theme. \n I feel like most stories about dreams end up going in a horror-esque direction. \n I tried putting in just enough horror flavor as to not take it too far.", "This is the First Week theme. \n Have you ever dreamt about flying? \n I regularly have dreams where I'm skiing down a steep slope as if I'm flying. \n Whenever I have that dream, it's usually when I'm feeling in pretty good shape.", "This is the Second Week theme. \n Sometimes you have dreams where the events have no sense of reality, and you're left with nothing \n ut a feeling of fatigue afterward. That irritating sort of dream is what I envisioned here. \n You have those sometimes, right? Dreams that exhaust you even though you forget what happened.", "This is the Third Week theme. \n A song with the usual Touhou-ness to it. \n I made it with the image of a finale that could stretch on forever if you left it alone. \n Am I the only one who thinks that horror dreams feel extremely nice? \n I'm always fantasizing about horror stuff as I fall asleep, but I only get those dreams sometimes.", "This is Story Theme 1. \n *From Kyuuyaku Sakaba ~ Dateless Bar \"Old Adam\".", "This is Story Theme 2. \n *From Kyuuyaku Sakaba ~ Dateless Bar \"Old Adam\".", "This is Story Theme 3. \n From Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom.", "This is Story Theme 4. \n From Hidden Star in Four Seasons."
