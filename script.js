  //Story of Eastern Wonderland
  "The title theme. It's a pretty long song for a title screen, so the demo will start if you try to listen to the whole thing. \n So, what part of this is Eastern?", "The first stage theme. It (the atmosphere) sounds heavy. A lot of shmups have really upbeat first stage themes, and this song is, too, but it's so dark. Even though the story for this game is a joke, the music is so serious, and the enemies are so hard. \n I like that kind of mismatch.", "The stage 1 boss theme. I tried to make it feel as weak as possible. I think this song sounds a little oriental.", "The second stage theme, I actually wrote this quite some time ago, so I think it feels different than the other songs. Actually, I wrote this song envisioning the dawn, but there weren't any scenes like that in the game, so I'm using it for a night scene. I wanted it to contrast the first stage theme - day and night, light and darkness - but the first stage theme was too heavy. Mmmm~", "The stage 2 boss theme. I tried making something cool, but it's really short, isn't it?", "I wonder just where the World of Fantasies is? I don't think it's anywhere in outer space, but...", "The third stage boss theme. The boss suddenly gets strong in this stage. However, the song has a long loop, so about the time the main melody ends; the boss should be dead.", "The '~ni moe' in the title means burning, I think it's definitely different from moe~ The rhythm is unusual. In a word, strange. Ah, what's Oriental about this song, anyway~", "Marisa's theme. She's the strongest magical girl. I tried to make the song feel like something from an anime, but try as I might, I just couldn't make something that had that heroine feel to it (I'm still practicing), so I tried to make something strong and witchy. I think it feels a little oriental.", "This was going to be the title song. Now it's an uninteresting stage 5 theme. To tell you the truth, this is the first song I made in PMD, so it didn't go that well, but it's the only song that changes rhythm. (The only one?) Still, it's the song I'm most familiar with.", "Mima's theme. There are a few points that I think are promised to last boss themes. Needless to say, it can't be too light, it can't be too simple, and it has to be mysterious, among other things. Of course, that's my opinion, so others may not agree.", "This is the Extra Stage song. This song and the next are all, are you sure you want to keep going? Let's do our best to beat the next person with a no continue clear. (Easy is fine, too.) So, that's what the song is like. Yep. Uja uja...", "The theme for a certain girl genius. At the early par, it's deliberately meant to feel particularly cute. In later part, I intended to finish the song in a cool style. The song uses the same progression as Extra Love. Still, conversely, this song is... too strong (^^;", "The ending song. It's a little dark, but the ending isn't really dark at all.", "The staff roll song. I thought the staff roll song should be an upbeat song with strong rhythm, but... It's energetic, but isn't it a little too dark?", "I made this, intending for it to be the first stage theme, but... Since the early songs in Highly Responsive to Prayers were so dark, so I thought I'd make this one brighter, and it ended up like this. But, I threw it out (^^;;;;", "I was going to use this for stage 2. It's not bad, but... It felt half-hearted, so I threw it out.", "I had planned on using this for the staff roll , but... The rhythm is so light it's almost unthinkable now (^^;;; It has a rather fine pedigree, but it didn't balance well with the other songs in the game, so I threw it out.",
  //Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream
  "This is the title music. Suddenly it doesn't seem too Touhou-like, right? \n Even if I do say so myself, for someone who's made music with such an unsuitable atmosphere I don't look too worried, I've been thinking lately. \n But lately, maybe it's because I've become accustomed to such an atmosphere, or maybe I actually am in this kind of atmosphere. I feel my game has to be like this or it's no good. \n In any case, right from the beginning I'm already talking about music like this. Oh no!", "What should I talk about for this song? (lol) \n It's a pretty heavy song, isn't it? \n Why is the character select song for a game with such a silly story like this? \n Oh well, it's pretty short... (The song, the development time, and the comments.)", "The game's main character also happens to be a shrine maiden, but... \n Is this really a shrine maiden's song? Well, uh. That's. You see. \n But, I do like it. And it does have a rather oriental feel to it, and the melody is pretty nice. Right? (Begging)", "For those who don't know Mima, she was the last boss from the last game, Story of Eastern Wonderland. \n This time, she's not a boss or anything, just a normal character, so I tried not to make her theme song too badass... \n You know, I just don't get her personality at all. \n (Even though she's my own character *sweatdrop*) \n Well, what about the song. The melody for the main chorus part is very simple, but feels really nice... Doesn't it? (Maybe because it's simple?)", "For those who don't know Mima, she was the last boss from the last game, Story of Eastern Wonderland. \n This time, she's not a boss or anything, just a normal character, so I tried not to make her theme song too badass... \n You know, I just don't get her personality at all. \n (Even though she's my own character *sweatdrop*) \n Well, what about the song. The melody for the main chorus part is very simple, but feels really nice... Doesn't it? (Maybe because it's simple?)", "Yeees. The composer is not too good at cute songs. This song doesn't seem very cute, does it? \n (If anyone knows the comic Ellen came from... sorry, it doesn't match her very well, does it?) \n Well, anyway, this song is actually a song I wrote a loooooong time ago to practice MIDI; I rewrote it all in FM. \n It was one of my favorite original songs, but it was completely Oriental-style, and... (I think this song is, too ...) I don't know how it ended up being a foreign girl's theme.", "She's a strange character. It's a strange song. Yes. \n What to say, what to say .... yeah. \n Well, I guess the high-speed xylophone-like sound is the main attraction for this song. \n Anyway, the melody's pretty weird. Do you all think so too? I knew it.", "She isn't human, either... \n When I'm making up characters, I'll write down a bunch on paper, and just choose some. This character has a pretty loli feel about her, but... \n The song is unusually cool. \n I said this before, but I'm not that good at making cute songs. This song turned out the same way... \n A cuter song would have been nice for this character... \n Aahhhh, all the songs feel kind of half-assed~ (It's cool, but it's got kind of girly instrumentation in it... ) Oh, well, it's okay. I guess I like this kind of song, after all.", "I like this song quite a bit, I really do, but it doesn't really fit the character at all, does it (^^; \n Oh well. This song's loop is pretty long, but it's pretty repetitive. \n Let's see, but, aside from the bosses, isn't it the coolest of the seven characters' themes? (Especially the main part, and even the intro)", "This song doesn't play in VS mode. Who the 7th is depends on which character you picked, but this song plays no matter who that was. So, if it's someone like Ellen, then this song will be totally out of place (^^; \nI was going for a boss feel, not a last boss feel, but... \n The main melody is almost the same as Reimu's theme. \n The main part is pretty cool... ...right? Well... maybe it's kind of odd?", "The demo is a little too long, isn't it? \n Honestly, since this song is so short, it has to loop a few times. \n Well, it seems like all the songs in this game are strangely cool ... \n By the way, if you press ESC during the demo, you can speed through it. If you press it twice, you can skip through it. Since it's a pretty pointless scene.", "This is the theme for the mid-boss who I don't know why she's there (^^; \n I was also going for a boss theme, not a last boss theme, but. Ummm. \n This is the only song in the game that's sycned up with the STAGE 8 START display. Did you notice? \n Well, anyway, that's a real sailor uniform. Er, ahh~", "This is pretty short. Still, I tried to give it that certain feeling. Well, that's about it.", "Well, I guess this is the last boss theme. I had a hard time with this one. Well, it turned out, so I guess it went well in the end. Since all the other characters' songs were pretty cool, I worked hard at this one. I ended up using a guitar-like sound, which I don't do often. And, the main part(?)'s melody was supposed to be really high-class, but. Maybe it's not?", "It's very ending-ish, but does it really match the ending scenes? ã€€Well, it's short.", "The song that plays during daytime endings. \n It definitely makes me think of shrines. Actually, this is the most shrine-maiden-ish song here, isn't it? \n See, doesn't this kind of song always play for shrines and shrine maidens in eroge? (lol)", "The song that plays during night-time endings. All the endings have a particular oriental feel to them. Hooray!", "Somehow it doesn't seem to fit the game at all either ... oh well. \n Still, I think this song works well as a staff roll song. \n It's cool, isn't it? Even if I'm the only member of the staff (lol) \n Maybe I put in too many weird parts~", "I remember finishing making this in no time at all. Well, it is a simple melody.", "", "", "I used this as I was building the game system before I made any characters. \n There weren't any characters that really fit this song, so I tossed it.", "A very spacey(?) song. \n I don't make many songs like this one. It's the only one that really seems like it's a STG song, but (because of that?) I tossed it. \n (Because there aren't any characters that fit this song!)", "For some reason, this song that actually has a pyramid feel to it got tossed. \n I wonder what kind of character would go with this song?"
